Meehan weighs in on Sony hackNever autoplay videosNorth Korea says it can prove it is not behind the massive Sony Pictures cyberattack that has led to several e-mail leaks threats on movie theaters and the cancellation of the release of the movie \xe2\x80\x9cThe Interview.\xe2\x80\x9dThe country has also said it proposes a joint investigation with the U.S. on the attack and if the U.S. does not agree North Korea warns of \xe2\x80\x9cgrave consequences \xe2\x80\x9d state media says.ADVERTISEMENTThe announcement comes as a response to the FBI\'s statement saying it has enough information to \xe2\x80\x9cconclude that the North Korean government is responsible\xe2\x80\x9d for the actions.The bureau said its findings were the result of an investigation that involved multiple departments and agencies and were based in part on technical analysis of the malware used in the attack. The FBI said the malware ""revealed links to other malware that the FBI knows North Korean actors previously developed.""Further the FBI noticed ""significant overlap between the infrastructure used in this attack and other malicious cyber activity the U.S. government has previously linked directly to North Korea."" For instance the FBI said several IP addresses with ""known North Korean infrastructure"" communicated with IP addresses ""hardcoded"" into the malware that ripped through Sony\'s systems deleting data and swiping sensitive information and rendering thousands of computers inoperable.The FBI also said the ""tools"" used in the attack are similar to those in a North Korea-led attack against South Korean banks and media outlets last year.""We are deeply concerned about the destructive nature of this attack on a private sector entity and the ordinary citizens who worked there "" the FBI said in its statement. ""Further North Korea\'s attack on SPE reaffirms that cyber threats pose one of the gravest national security dangers to the United States. Though the FBI has seen a wide variety and increasing number of cyber intrusions the destructive nature of this attack coupled with its coercive nature sets it apart.""North Korea\'s actions were intended to inflict significant harm on a U.S. business and suppress the right of American citizens to express themselves. Such acts of intimidation fall outside the bounds of acceptable state behavior.""Obama said in a press conference Friday that there was no indication that points to any other country working with North Korea in the attack.Obama vowed Friday: \xe2\x80\x9cWe will respond.\xe2\x80\x99Fox News\xe2\x80\x99 Lucas Tomlinson Catherine Herridge and Reuters contributed to this report.",http://us.cnn.com/2014/12/27/world/asia/north-korea-the-interview-reaction/index.html?hpt=wo_c2,North Korea lambasts U.S. over 'The Interview ' says Obama is the 'culprit',"(CNN) -- The North Korean government is fuming over the release of the ""The Interview "" claiming President Barack Obama forced the film into theaters and onto streaming video services.""U.S. President Obama is the chief culprit who forced the Sony Pictures Entertainment to 'indiscriminately distribute' the movie and took the lead in appeasing and blackmailing cinema houses and theatres in the U.S. mainland to distribute the movie "" North Korea's National Defense Commission said Saturday according to state-run media.""Obama always goes reckless in words and deeds like a monkey in a tropical forest.""In the screwball comedy a tabloid journalist who is granted an interview with North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un is asked to assassinate him.

The group also warned of severe attacks on movie theaters showing the film.In the cyberattack thieves took a possible record haul of 100 terabytes of data -- a slew of movies and other content company secrets personal information of employees and the Social Security numbers of celebrities.The FBI has blamed North Korea for that cyberattack. North Korea in turn slammed the United States for the accusation.""If the U.S. is to persistently insist that the hacking attack was made by the DPRK the U.S. should produce evidence without fail though belatedly "" said the North Korean Defense Commission statement carried Saturday by the state-run Korean Central News Agency.""If the U.S. persists in American-style arrogant high-handed and gangster-like arbitrary practices despite the repeated warnings of the DPRK the U.S. should bear in mind that its failed political affairs will face inescapable deadly blows.""U.S. accused over North Korean outagePyongyang's statement also accused the United States of being behind the crippling outage of North Korea's Internet last week.""The U.S. a big country started disturbing the internet operation of major media of the DPRK "" it said.The U.S. government last week declined to say whether it was responsible for the Internet disruption in North Korea. Obama had earlier warned the United States would ""respond proportionally"" to the Sony hack.Obama had also expressed disappointment at the movie's suspension saying free speech had been stifled.""We cannot have a society in which some dictators someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States because if somebody is able to intimidate us out of releasing a satirical movie imagine what they start doing once they see a documentary that they don't like or news reports that they don't like "" Obama said last week.""That's not who we are. That's not what America is about.""Who's behind the Sony cyberattackThe FBI has said that the code of the malware used in the attack on Sony is similar to what North Korea has used in other attacks.But that code was leaked a long time ago cyberexperts say and any hacker around the world could have used it.Some U.S. cyberexperts say the evidence the FBI has presented isn't enough to isolate North Korea as the culprit.""It's clear to us based on both forensic and other evidence we've collected that unequivocally they are not responsible for orchestrating or initiating the attack on Sony "" said Sam Glines who runs cybersecurity company Norse.CNN has reached out to the FBI for comment on such doubt but has not heard back.$1 million in one dayAfter Sony Pictures said film distributors had decided not to show ""The Interview"" for security reasons Sony then arranged for direct distribution online via its own services YouTube and through independent cinemas.A few hundred movie theaters decided to go ahead and show the film on Christmas.Sony had originally planned to release the movie in 2 000 to 3 000 theaters but only about 300 played it.

""The pilot managed to land it on the sea's surface.""The theory that passengers were alive at some point after impact appeared to be supported by Jusman Syafii Djamal the former transport minister who said that the fact that the emergency door was found intact may be evidence that the door was opened.The Airbus A320 crashed into the Java Sea on Sunday with 162 people on board. Sixteen bodies have been recovered so far. Seven were announced Friday morning six of which were found by a U.S. Navy ship said Suryadi B. Supriyadi operation coordinator for the National Search and Rescue Agency.Jimmy Sponder the CEO of Aviation Consultant Expert Solutions was skeptical of the theory. Sponder who told FoxNews.com that he worked for years on the same model plane that crashed said there would have likely been survivors if the plane did land successfully.More ships arrived Friday with sensitive equipment to hunt for the fuselage of AirAsia Flight 8501 and the more than 145 people still missing since it crashed into the sea five days ago.AirAsia Indonesia Flight QZ8501 Update (as of 1 January 2015 8:00 PM (GMT+7) http://t.co/jHR0dsOa66 AirAsia (@AirAsia) January 1 2015Aviation expert Geoffrey Thomas in Australia said there's a chance the plane hit the water largely intact and that many passengers remain inside it.He added that bodies recovered so far would have come out with a breach in the fuselage. ""But most passengers still should have had their seat belts on particularly as the plane was going into weather. The captain would have still had the seat belt sign on.""Much of the crash remains a mystery. It's unclear what brought the plane down about halfway into its two-hour flight to Singapore. The jet's last communication indicated the pilots were worried about bad weather. They sought permission to climb above threatening clouds but were denied because of heavy air traffic. Four minutes later the airliner disappeared from the radar without issuing a distress signal.The black boxes hold key data that will help investigators determine the cause of the crash but they have yet to be recovered. Items found so far include a life jacket an emergency exit door an inflatable slide children's shoes and luggage.Indonesia's Search and Rescue Agency chief Henry Bambang Soelistyo said efforts would be stepped up as long as the weather allowed.""We will focus on underwater detection "" he said adding ships from Indonesia Malaysia Singapore and the U.S. had been on the scene since before dawn Friday to try to pinpoint wreckage and the all-important black boxes the flight data and cockpit voice recorders.But he said bad weather which has hindered the search the last several days was a worry. A drizzle and light clouds covered the area Friday morning but rain strong winds and high waves up to 13 feet were forecast until Sunday.Strong sea currents have also kept debris moving.Soelistyo estimated the fuselage was at a depth of 80 feet to 100 feet and vowed to recover the bodies of ""our brothers and sisters ... whatever conditions we face.""The longer the search takes the more corpses will decompose and the farther debris will scatter.Fox News' Edmund DeMarche and The Associated Press contributed to this report",http://us.cnn.com/2015/01/01/world/asia/airasia-disaster/index.html?hpt=wo_c2,The search for AirAsia Flight QZ8501: Where things stand,"(CNN) -- Searchers looking for more bodies and wreckage from AirAsia Flight QZ8501 in the Java Sea faced fresh difficulties with bad weather Thursday.Ships planes and helicopters are being used to find victims of the disaster. Most of the people on board the flight remain missing and officials are yet to confirm that they've found the plane's fuselage.Here's key information about where things stand:The flightWhat we know: Flight QZ8501 took off early Sunday from Surabaya Indonesia bound for Singapore. Roughly 35 minutes into the flight the pilot asked air traffic control for permission to turn left and climb to a higher altitude to avoid bad weather. Minutes later the plane disappeared from air traffic control's radar.What we don't know: What happened on board after contact with the plane was lost. No distress call was received. Indonesian aviation authorities have suggested that the plane ascended despite permission being denied because of traffic.Some experts have speculated that the aircraft might have experienced an aerodynamic stall because of a lack of speed or from flying at too sharp an angle to get enough lift. Analysts have also suggested that the pilots might not have been getting information from onboard systems about the plane's position or that rain or hail from thunderstorms in the area could have damaged the engines.Until the main wreckage of the plane is found along with the flight recorders experts have little evidence to support their theories.How can a modern airliner vanish?The searchWhat we know: Search teams found debris and some bodies in the water Tuesday 100 to 200 kilometers (about 60 to 120 miles) from the aircraft's last known location over the Java Sea Indonesia's search and rescue agency said. Nine bodies have been recovered authorities say one of them a woman wearing a flight attendant's uniform.Indonesia is leading the international search effort with assistance from a range of countries including Malaysia Singapore and the United States.What we don't know: The exact location of the body of the aircraft. An Indonesian search official told CNN on Wednesday that he thought sonar equipment had detected wreckage from Flight 8501 at the bottom of the Java Sea. But the country's search and rescue chief said the plane hadn't been found yet. Bad weather has hindered the search operation.The ones who missed the flightThe people on boardWhat we know: The plane was carrying 155 passengers and seven crew members. The overwhelming majority of those on board were Indonesians. There were also citizens of Britain France Malaysia Singapore and South Korea. Details are emerging about some of the people on the flight recounted by family members and friends.What we don't know: Which passengers and crew members' remains have been retrieved and which still remain missing in the Java Sea. On Thursday Indonesian authorities announced the identification of one of the recovered bodies: a woman named Hayati Lutfiah Hamid. They are still working to identify the others. Many family members are waiting in Surabaya for news about their loved ones.Who was aboard AirAsia Flight QZ8501?The investigationWhat we know: The key to understanding what happened may be in the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder commonly known as black boxes. The black boxes which are actually orange are in the tail of Airbus 320-200s. If recovered they will be taken to a lab in Jakarta Indonesia to be analyzed said Tatang Kurniadi head of Indonesia's National Committee for Transportation Safety. The batteries powering the ""pingers"" that send acoustic signals have only about 25 days of power left he said.What we don't know: Where plane's remains might have been taken by the elements. Investigators will need to use information gleaned from the flight recorders but also clues from the wreckage itself.""The more bits I can put into my mosaic the better my picture will be "" aviation safety expert Michael Barr said. ""The better the picture the better I can come up with an understanding of what happened."" But the conditions at sea make that work much more difficult than on land. ""In the water you are working with currents and winds and so the pieces won't be where they had the initial impact.""What happens next?The plane and the pilotsWhat we know: The 6-year-old Airbus A320-200 operated by AirAsia's Indonesian affiliate had accumulated around 23 000 flight hours in about 13 600 flights according to Airbus. The plane's last scheduled maintenance was on November 16.Flight 8501's veteran captain Iriyanto 53 had 20 537 flying hours 6 100 of them with AirAsia on the Airbus A320 the airline said. The first officer Remi Emmanuel Plesel 46 had 2 275 flying hours a reasonable amount for his position.What we don't know: Whether technical problems human error or other issues were involved in the crash. According to information from the Aviation Safety Network accident database there have been 54 incidents involving the A320.""In the A320 family accidents and incidents range from fan-cowl detachment landing gear collapse bird strikes right through to hull losses through pilot error "" said Kane Ray an analyst with the International Bureau of Aviation a global aviation consulting group. ""Most aircraft have teething problems and in most cases these are eradicated. Very rarely these issues cause disasters -- largely because of a culmination of factors that lead to the event "" Ray said.Anguish revisited: Relatives of MH370 victims speak out about AirAsia Flight QZ8501",http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/01/02/airasia-jet-may-have-made-safe-landing-on-sea-before-sinking-expert-says/ http://us.cnn.com/2015/01/01/world/asia/airasia-disaster/index.html?hpt=wo_c25,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/12/29/gunmen-fire-on-lapd-patrol-car-in-south-la/,LAPD officers fired on in 'unprovoked attack'," (FOX 11)A Los Angeles Police Department patrol car was fired on in an unprovoked attack Sunday night that put police officers around the city on tactical alert.The shooting took place late Sunday in a neighborhood in South Los Angeles as two officers were responding to an unrelated radio call.A couple of officers were rolling down the street when they observed the muzzle of a rifle firing in their direction LAPD Sgt.

""But rest assured "" he said that once the investigation is done if ""there are things we need to change that we will change it.""The Airbus A320-200 lost contact with air traffic control early Sunday shortly after the pilot requested permission to turn and climb to a higher altitude because of bad weather according to Indonesian officials.Authorities mounted a huge effort to find the aircraft mapping out a search zone covering 156 000 square kilometers.Questions remain unanswered about why Flight 8501 lost contact with air traffic control and what happened afterward.Some experts have said the aircraft might have experienced an aerodynamic stall because of a lack of speed or from flying at too sharp an angle to get enough lift.Analysts have also suggested that the pilots might not have been getting information from onboard systems about the plane's position or that rain or hail from thunderstorms in the area could have damaged the engines.The key to understanding what happened is likely to be contained in the aircraft's flight recorders.""Until we get the black boxes we won't know what's going on with the engines "" Bill Savage a former pilot with 30 years of experience told CNN.'It was to be his last vacation with his family'Details have emerged about some of the people on board the plane.They include Alain Oktavianus Siauw whose fiance says she was on her way to the airport to pick him up when she heard the plane had gone missing.Louise Sidharta said Siauw was supposed to be enjoying a family vacation before the two got married. ""It was to be his last vacation with his family "" she said.Siauw's Facebook page says he lives in Malang a province in Indonesia.The disappearance of Flight 8501 also stirred painful memories of the families of people on board Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 which dropped off radar over the South China Sea in March.Nearly 10 months later searchers are still combing remote reaches of the southern Indian Ocean for any trace of the Boeing 777 that had 239 people on board.""The lack of ability to close things down emotionally is just exhausting "" Sarah Bajc told CNN on Monday night.

By the time Iriyanto returned it was too late to save the plane.Iriyanto reportedly had previously flown on the A320 airbus and experienced a faulty FAC which he apparently went to fix. Reuters was unable to offer independent confirmation of the faulty device.After trying to reset the device pilots pulled a circuit-breaker to cut its power Bloomberg News reported on Friday.``You can reset the FAC but to cut all power to it is very unusual '' one A320 pilot who declined to be identified told Reuters. ``You don't pull the circuit breaker unless it was an absolute emergency. I don't know if there was one in this case but it is very unusual.''Pulling the circuit breaker is also an unusual move because the captain would have had to rise from his seat.AirAsia said it will not comment while the matter is under investigation.Click for the full story from Reuters. ,http://us.cnn.com/2015/01/20/asia/airasia-disaster-flight-speed/index.html,AirAsia flight climbed quickly  then stalled before crash  reports say,"Story highlightsPlane was climbing twice as fast as it should have been analyst saysAirAsia Flight QZ8501 ""went up faster than normal "" Indonesia's transportation minister saysAt one point the plane climbed at a speed of 6 000 feet per minute he says(CNN)AirAsia Flight QZ8501 climbed rapidly before it crashed a top Indonesian official said Tuesday.Then the plane stalled Transportation Minister Ignasius Jonan said at a parliamentary hearing according to the AFP and Reuters news agencies.""The plane during the last minutes went up faster than normal speed ... after then it stalled. That is according to the data from the radar "" Jonan said according to the news agencies.At one point the plane was climbing at a speed of 6 000 feet per minute Jonan told the hearing.A fighter jet like the F/A-18 Super Hornet can barrel through the air at 30 000 feet per minute. But commercial jets are designed to travel at a much slower rate.The latest data shows the AirAsia plane an Airbus A320 was climbing at a rate that was twice as fast as it ""could and should do on its own "" CNN Aviation Analyst Mary Schiavo said.""I think that means there was a tremendous amount of winds and weather "" she said.The commercial jet lost contact with air traffic controllers on December 28 as it flew from the Indonesian city of Surabaya toward Singapore with 162 people on board.Amid increasingly bad weather one of the pilots had requested to deviate from the plane's planned route AirAsia has said. And experts have speculated since Day One that storms might have played a role in the plane crash.If the plane was climbing at 6 000 feet per minute Schiavo said numerous alarms would have sounded in the cockpit. But if the aircraft got caught in an updraft she said the pilots might not have been aware at first of why it was climbing so quickly when they weren't inputting that into the controls.Picture your speedometer showing your car accelerating when your foot isn't pressing on the gas pedal.""The pilots would have had control of the plane "" she said ""but may not have even realized what was occurring because of the confusing readings from the aircraft.""Last week searchers recovered the plane's so-called black boxes which investigators hope will help them determine what happened aboard the doomed flight.Indonesian investigators say audio recordings from the plane's cockpit contain no sounds of gunfire or explosions making it unlikely the plane was brought down by terrorism.While transportation officials focus on figuring out what happened search teams are still looking for most of the bodies of the people who were on board the plane.More than three weeks after the crash the remains of 53 people have been recovered some of them still strapped into seats. Many of the rest could be in the wreckage of the fuselage which searchers located last week at the bottom of the sea.Efforts to examine and get inside the wreckage have been hindered by high waves and strong currents.",http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/02/01/airasia-captain-left-seat-before-jet-lost-control-sources-say/ http://us.cnn.com/2015/01/20/asia/airasia-disaster-flight-speed/index.html8,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/01/15/3-reportedly-killed-in-counter-terrorism-raid-in-belgium/,More counterterrorism raids reportedly underway in Belgium after police thwart 'Belgian Charlie Hebdo' attack,"Belgium: Major imminent attacks thwarted by terror raidNever autoplay videosMore counterterrorism operations were reportedly underway in Belgium late Thursday hours after police killed at least two in raids aimed at jihadists returning from Syria who were planning to launch a ""Belgian Charlie Hebdo"" attack authorities said.Belgian news site L'Avenir as well as Le Soir and France24 reported that the government prosecutor's office said a dozen operations have been launched against suspects across Belgium in Verviers Brussels and Hal-Vilvoorde. Some of those targeted in the raids are known to have returned recently from Syria.The Belgian news site reported that based on phone intercepts in the homes and cars of the three individuals involved in a shootout in Verviers authorities believed the three were in the process of carrying out imminent attacks inside Belgium. A shootout between the three and police has left two of the suspected terrorists dead and another wounded.The French daily Le Soir is reporting that the investigations were launched against the Verviers suspects at least two weeks ago after they returned from Syria where they were thought to be involved in the fighting there.The raids earlier Thursday included one on an apartment above a bakery in the eastern city of Verviers authorities said. They said no officers were injured and that the suspects opened fire on them as the swooped in. Authorities said the terror cell had ties to ISIS and was planning a major attack.""We've averted a Belgian Charlie Hebdo "" an unidentified police officer told La Meuse.It was not immediately known if the suspects in Belgium had direct links to the terror cell that carried out last week's attacks in Paris. But much of Europe is deeply concerned about homegrown jihadists sympatizers - and passport holders - who are returning battle-hardened from Iraq and Syria. Thursday's raids came as a man suspected of selling guns used in last weeks terror attacks in France was being detained in another part of the country.""We've averted a Belgian Charlie Hebdo.""- Belgian police officerMagistrate Eric Van der Sypt told reporters in Brussels that the suspects were on the verge of committing a major terrorist attack. He said at an emergency news conference that Belgium's terror alert level was raised to its second highest level. The raids were part of an investigation into extremists returning from Syria.The public prosecutors office confirmed the deaths of two suspects and arrests of ""several"" more. Federal prosecutors were quoted as saying there had been a police operation aimed at jihadists who have returned from the Middle East to the city of 55 000 some 70 miles from Brussels.Explosions and gunfire were apparently heard near the station according to Belgium's public broadcaster RTBF. The Belga news agency said there were several casualties and police activity was continuing. Another official told the agency it was ""jihadist-related"" and a news conference was scheduled for 8 p.m. local time.Earlier Reuters reported that Belgian authorities detained a man for arms dealing and are investigating whether he supplied one of the Islamist gunmen involved in the attacks in Paris including a raid on the headquarters of satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo and a separate siege at a Jewish supermarket two days later. A total of 17 victims and three terrorists were killed in the events.Belgian media reported that the suspect turned himself in in the southern city of Charleroi on Tuesday saying he had been in touch with Amedy Coulibaly the behind the supermarket attack.According to the reports the man said that he swindled Coulibaly in a car sale but police later found evidence that the two were negotiating about the sale of ammunition for a 7.62 mm caliber firearm.A member of the Belgian security forces at the scene of the incident. (Sky News)""The man is being held by the judge in Charleroi on suspicion of arms dealing "" a spokesman for Belgium's federal prosecution said. ""Further investigations will have to show whether there is a link with the events in Paris "" he added.It was not known if the raid in Belgium was directly related to recent events in France but the nations share a 385-mile border and are close culturally and politically.On Sunday the offices of Belgian newspaper Le Soir a French-language publication that published caricatures of Prophet Muhammad to show solidarity with Charlie Hebdo were evacuated after a bomb threat. Also on Sunday thousands marched through Brussels to show support for the French tabloid which was targeted by a pair of radicalized brothers because of its penchant for publishing images of Islam's prophet.A German tabloid that reprinted caricatures of Muhammad was firebombed on Sunday. But Charlie Hebdo came out with a new issue on Wednesday with a caricature of Muhammad on the cover under the title ""Tout est pardonne "" or ""All is forgiven.""",http://us.cnn.com/2015/01/16/europe/france-charlie-hebdo-attacks/index.html,Suspects detained in Paris over attacks as Kerry visits,"Story highlightsAt least a dozen people are detained in Paris in connection with last week's shootingsU.S. Secretary of State John Kerry pays respects to the victims of the attacksParis (CNN)At least a dozen people have been detained in the Paris region overnight in connection with last week's shootings the city prosecutor's office said Friday.The people arrested are suspected of providing logistical support for the attacks.The arrests were made in the Grigny and Fleury-Merogis neighborhoods and those arrested were in Amedy Coulibaly's entourage the Paris prosecutor's representative said.Coulibaly was killed last Friday in a police siege to end a hostage taking at a kosher supermarket in Paris. He had killed four hostages and is believed also to have shot a policewoman to death in the city a day earlier.Two days before Coulibaly was killed brothers Said and Cherif Kouachi had attacked the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo killing 12 people and injuring 11. They died the same day as Coulibaly as police moved in to end a separate siege.Who were the victims?The country's frayed nerves will not be eased by the Belgian authorities' operation Thursday to dismantle a suspected terror cell believed to be on the brink of carrying out attacks on police.However investigators have so far found no links with events in Paris Belgian prosecutor Eric Van Der Sypt said Friday.Meanwhile in the French city of Reims about 90 miles (145 kilometers) northeast of Paris the City Hall confirmed Friday that a police operation had taken place and that there had been gunfire.It's not clear whether this is related to the investigation of the Paris attacks. However Reims was the hometown of Said Kouachi.At the same time a man with a handgun entered a post office in Colombes a northwestern suburb of Paris according to the local police department. Police said the man might be mentally unstable and that they did not know yet if this was terror-related.According to French media there are up to five hostages inside the post office.Kerry: Heartfelt condolencesIn his first visit to France since last week's terror attacks U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry said Friday that he ""really wanted to come here and share a hug with all of Paris and all of France.""Standing alongside Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo Kerry added that he ""wanted to express to you personally the sheer horror and revulsion"" over what he called a ""living nightmare.""Singer James Taylor also appeared crooning a customized version of his 1971 hit song ""You've Got a Friend.""Kerry met earlier with President Francois Hollande when he voiced the ""full and heartfelt condolences"" of Americans.""We watched the people of France come together with a great sense of purpose and unity. It was a great lesson to the world that once again France's commitment to freedom and passion of ideas has made an important statement to the world "" Kerry said.Kerry laid a wreath at a makeshift memorial at the site of the kosher supermarket attack Friday accompanied by Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius. Kerry and Fabius spoke there for several minutes with Joel Mergui the president of Consistoire du Paris a national Jewish organization.Mayor: 'Threat is still very high'Kerry and Fabius also paid their respects at the offices of Charlie Hebdo.Francois Vauglin the mayor of Paris' 11th district where the offices are located told CNN that Kerry's visit was very welcome. ""It's so important for us to feel supported at this time "" he said.The street is still cordoned off as investigators continue to comb the area for clues adding to the sense of disquiet for local residents he said.""We know that the threat is still very high and we don't know how long we will be able to withstand this threat "" he said.President Barack Obama's administration has admitted it erred by not sending a senior figure to a huge unity march held Sunday in Paris. More than 40 world leaders including the British German and Israeli heads of state and Russia's foreign minister joined at least 1.5 million people on the French capital's streets.Funerals for Charlie Hebdo victimsThe goodbyes continue Friday after the attack on the Charlie Hebdo offices.Funerals are being held for magazine editor Stephane ""Charb"" Charbonnier illustrator Philippe Honore and Algerian-born copy editor Mustapha Ourrad.The question of where to bury their killers is more contentious.Cherif Kouachi's widow Izzana Kouachi has requested that both he and his brother Said Kouachi be buried in Gennevilliers on the outskirts of Paris.The Gennevilliers mayor's office told CNN on Friday that the city was obliged by law to bury Cherif Kouachi there as he was a resident of the city.But a spokesman for the mayor Jean-Francois Boye said that it would not do the same for Said because he lived in Reims.""That's for sure he's not from Gennevilliers we won't let him get a funeral here "" Boye said.Anger over cartoonA ""survivors' issue"" of Charlie Hebdo was published Wednesday -- the first since the attack. Copies have flown off the racks of newsstands despite a print run of more than 4 million.However the magazine's decision to run a cartoon of the Prophet Mohammed on the front cover -- not for the first time -- has been criticized by a number of Muslim leaders since this is deeply offensive to many Muslims.Anger over the cartoon boiled over into violence Friday in Pakistan where police resorted to using tear gas and water cannons to disperse protesters outside the French Consulate in Karachi.A Pakistani photographer for AFP was shot and injured at the protest the French news agency reported. He is ""doing better "" it said via Twitter.Ahmed Chinoy chief of Karachi's Citizen Police Liaison Committee told CNN that investigations were underway to determine who shot the journalist.At least 200 protesters were involved in the violence which broke out after religious parties called supporters out to condemn the cartoon following afternoon prayers Chinoy said.The protests come a day after Pakistan's Parliament unanimously passed a resolution condemning the caricatures printed in Charlie Hebdo.Internet outageSeveral French media outlets' websites went down Friday morning including those of radio station France Inter newspapers Le Parisien and 20 Minutes weekly magazines L'Express and Marianne and investigative publication Mediapart.This prompted speculation that the outage could be the result of a hack linked to publication of the Charlie Hebdo cover. But Internet service provider Oxalide said it was not the result of a cyberattack.With France on its highest level of alert 10 000 troops have deployed across the country. Thousands of police officers are on patrol including hundreds assigned to protect Jewish schools.Terror raidAs France still reels from the shock of the Paris attacks authorities in neighboring Belgium swooped in on an alleged terror cell in an operation that left two suspects dead.Prosecutor Van Der Sypt said weapons and police uniforms were recovered as part of raids on a dozen properties in Belgium in which 13 people were arrested. The plan was to kill police officers on public roads or in police offices he said.Two people were also arrested in France he said and Belgium will be asking for them to be extradited.They are Belgian nationals who belong to the alleged cell but were found in France he said.A Western intelligence source told CNN that the ongoing terror threat appears to involve up to 20 sleeper cells of between 120 and 180 people ready to strike in France Germany Belgium and the Netherlands.Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility Wednesday for the Charlie Hebdo shooting.The attack was years in the making AQAP commander Nasr Ibn Ali al-Ansi said in a video claiming U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki was the mastermind behind it.Suspected arms dealer detainedIn the days since last week's attacks security services have been working to track those associated with the Kouachi brothers and Coulibaly.Neetin Karasular a suspected Belgian trafficker in weapons who met Coulibaly's widow Hayat Boumeddiene is in custody Karasular's attorney Michel Bouchat told CNN on Friday.Karasular has been charged with association with wrongdoers and offenses relating to firearms in a case handled by the local public prosecutor's office in Charleroi Belgium.According to Bouchat police didn't find any weapons at Karasular's house.

The Republican takeover of the Senate last November -- and the party's historic gains in the House -- for a short time fueled speculation that the president might entertain a more conciliatory approach with Congress. But within weeks the president announced sweeping changes to immigration policy via executive action. Then he vowed to veto a slew of bills from the new Congress including one to undo those executive actions. And now his State of the Union address leaves little doubt that Obama as he told Senate Democrats last week plans to play ""offense"" against the GOP-led Congress. The latest plank of his 2015 agenda was unveiled Saturday night and calls for more than $300 billion in new tax increases over the next 10 years to pay for middle class tax credits and his community college plan among other programs. Already Republicans are describing the plan as a ""non-starter"" with the new Congress. ""More Washington tax hikes and spending is the same old top-down approach we've come to expect from President Obama that hasn't worked "" Michel Steel spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner R-Ohio said. Don Stewart deputy chief of staff for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell R-Ky. ripped the president's plan and renewed calls to overhaul to whole tax system. ""Republicans believe we should simplify America's outdated tax code; that tax filing should be easier for you not just those with fancy accountants; and that tax reform should create jobs for families not the IRS "" he said in a statement. The president unlike past years has previewed many elements of his State of the Union address in the run-up to the speech. Some like the tax plan have already attracted Republican ire. They include: Tax hikes to pay for tax cuts: The centerpiece of the president's tax proposal is an increase in the capital gains rate on couples making more than $500 000 per year to 28 percent the same level as under President Ronald Reagan. The top capital gains rate has already been raised from 15 percent to 23.8 percent during Obama's presidency. Obama also wants to close what the administration is calling the ""trust fund loophole "" a change that would require estates to pay capital gains taxes on securities at the time they're inherited. Officials said the overwhelming impact of the change would be on the top 1 percent of income earners. Administration officials pointed to a third proposal from the president as one they hope Republicans would support: a fee on the roughly 100 U.S. financial firms with assets of more than $50 billion. Raising the capital gains rate ending the inheritance loophole and tacking a fee on financial firms would generate $320 billion in revenue over a decade according to administration estimates. Obama wants to put the bulk of that money into a series of measures aimed at helping middle-class Americans. This would include expanding the child care tax credit offering up to $3 000 per child for families making up to $120 000 a year. And it would include a new $500 credit to ""second earners"" in a family to help a spouse pay for additional costs entailed when both spouses work -- like child care. Free community college: The president wants to offer two years of free community college to students who can keep a 2.5 GPA. The White House estimates the program would cost the federal government roughly $60 billion over 10 years. The White House wants the federal government covering three-quarters of tuition costs and states picking up the rest. Workplace leave: Obama is urging Congress and local governments to back measures allowing workers to earn up to a week of paid sick time a year. As part of this effort he wants Congress to approve more than $2 billion in new spending to encourage states to create paid family and medical leave programs. In addition Obama will take steps to provide federal employees with up to six weeks of paid sick leave to care for a new child. And he'll propose that Congress pass legislation to give federal workers an additional six weeks of paid parental leave. Infrastructure: The administration is proposing to create a new municipal bond for public-private partnerships. A new Water Finance Center at the Environmental Protection Agency also will work with state and local governments utilities and the private sector to use federal grants to leverage private capital to address more than $600 billion in needs for drinking water and wastewater management. Housing help: Obama earlier this month announced plans the White House says could save homeowners $900 a year. Under the plan at the end of this month the Federal Housing Administration mortgage premium will drop from 1.35 percent to 0.85 percent. In addition to the 250 000 new homebuyers the White House hopes to attract -- a figure that marks a modest increase in sales -- administration officials said the rate cut would help 800 000 homeowners who refinance their mortgages.

Despite reams of positive economic news most Americans still say economic conditions in the country are only fair.And if they see improvement they aren't crediting the White House.""The middle class has yet to experience the prosperity shown in the recovery and what you'll see Tuesday night is the vision for finishing that job "" a senior administration official said.Obama is set to propose Tuesday a $500 tax credit for married couples who each hold jobs; the intention officials say is to help alleviate the costs of child care and commuting that lead some spouses -- usually women -- to determine it makes more financial sense to stop working.He'll also spell out ways to simplify the way taxpayers apply for education and child care credits including increasing the top child care credit to $3 000.The total cost for the new provisions: $235 billion according to administration officials who spoke anonymously ahead of the plan's official unveiling. For the first time since becoming president all of Obama's changes would need to be approved both by a GOP House and a Senate with a new Republican majority.Looking to increase capital gains rateTo pay for the changes the administration is proposing about $320 billion in new revenue over the next decade. Obama wants to wring more taxes from investment income -- capital gains and dividends -- which are taxed at a lower rate than ordinary earnings. Since wealthy Americans are more likely to derive income from investments they'd bear the overwhelming weight of a higher rate on that type of profit.The tax rate for capital gains now stands at 20% for the highest-earning Americans. Officials said Saturday that Obama will call for that rate to increase to 28% for those taxpayers.He will ask lawmakers to close a loophole allowing capital gains on inherited funds to go untaxed -- a so-called ""trust fund"" loophole the White House says allows billions of dollars in capital gains to go untapped by the government every year.""This proposal is doing what it is intended to do which is to make sure that the large accumulated unearned wealth of the wealthiest Americans is actually subject to tax "" an Obama administration official said. ""We are quite confident that we can do this in a way that achieves that objective while in fact helping middle-class families by putting those resources to better use.""The arguments against raising tax rates on investment income are well established: opponents argue it poses a ""double tax"" scenario since the corporate profits that drive stock prices are already subject to taxes. And they stress some portion of investment gains is driven by inflation.But Republicans aren't necessarily opposed to altering how investment income is taxed: last year's proposal from the top Republican on the House tax writing committee Rep. Dave Camp called for applying ordinary income tax rates on 60% of capital gains and excluding the other 40% altogether. That put the top rate at 21%.In his speech Tuesday Obama also plans to all for a new fee on large financial institutions which administration officials estimated would bring in $110 billion; Camp's plan called for an excise tax on large banks.""I would say that a number of the ideas that the President is outlining in this new proposal do have --already have -- clear congressional bipartisan support "" a senior administration official said Saturday.Republicans were dismissive of the tax initiatives unveiled Saturday evening.""This is not a serious proposal "" Brendan Buck spokesman for House Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan told CNN. ""We lift families up and grow the economy with a simpler flatter tax code not big tax increases to pay for more Washington spending.""Obama has spent the last two weeks offering up an advance look at his State of the Union address including the community college proposal a plan to expand high-speed Internet and reducing rates of federally backed mortgages.The early look is meant to introduce Americans to each scheme individually said administration aides who determined the yearly laundry-list of plans -- combined with updates on America's foreign policy -- wasn't digestible during a single prime-time event.That doesn't mean however the speech will necessarily be any shorter than the 65-minute address Obama delivered last year.""It will still be a healthy speech in terms of breadth and length "" one official said.Why Obama's going to India after his State of the Union speech",11,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/03/26/more-questions-than-answers-after-report-that-germanwings-pilot-locked-out/,Germanwings co-pilot wanted to 'destroy the plane ' locked pilot out of cockpit  says prosecutor,"Prosecutor: Co-pilot wanted to destroy planeNever autoplay videosThe co-pilot of Germanwings 9525 had sole control of the doomed flight that crashed into the French Alps early Tuesday and ""wanted to destroy this plane "" a French prosecutor said Thursday.The cockpit voice recorder recovered on Wednesday from the rugged terrain north of Nice appeared to show the pilot locked out of the cockpit and knocking on the door first politely then frantically in the moments before the jet carrying 150 passengers and crew began a rapid descent that killed all aboard.In a Paris news conference Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said the evidence from the cockpit voice recorder one of two ""black boxes"" and the only one recovered so far seems to show the co-pilot identified as Andreas Lubitz refusing to open the cabin door as he began the eight-minute descent ""manually and intentionally.""

Robin insisted in a news conference Thursday morning that Lubitz a German from the central city of Montabaur was not a known terrorist.""A terrorist?"" he said in response to a question. ""Absolutely not.""More on this...What could have caused Germanwings A320's crash?Still it was the co-pilot's ""intention to destroy this plane "" Robin said. The recorder captured his normal breathing patterns suggesting Lubitz was not incapacitated.""It wasn't the breath of somebody who was struggling the prosecutor said. He didn't say a single word. Total silence.""Asked when passengers realize there fate Robin said ""We only hear screams at the very end. Death was instant.Robin said the commander of the plane knocked several times ""without response."" He said the door could only be blocked manually.He said the co-pilot's responses initially courteous became ""curt"" when the captain began the mid-flight briefing on the planned landing.The information was pulled from the black box cockpit voice recorder but Robin said the co-pilot did not say a word after the commanding pilot left the cockpit.""It was absolute silence in the cockpit "" he said.During the final minutes of the flight's descent pounding could be heard on the cockpit door as plane alarms sounded but the co-pilot's breathing was normal throughout the whole time Robin said.""It's obvious this co-pilot took advantage of the commander's absence. Could he have known he would leave? It is too early to say "" he said.In the German town of Montabaur acquaintances told The Associated Press that Lubitz showed no signs of depression when they saw him last fall as he renewed his glider pilot's license.""He was happy he had the job with Germanwings and he was doing well "" said a member of the glider club Peter Ruecker who watched Lubitz learn to fly. ""He gave off a good feeling.""Lubitz had obtained his glider pilot's license as a teenager and was accepted as a Lufthansa pilot trainee after finishing a tough German college preparatory school Ruecker said. He described Lubitz as a ""rather quiet"" but friendly young man.The airline said the captain had more than 6 000 hours of flying time and been Germanwings pilot since May 2014 having previously flown for Lufthansa and Condor a German leisure airline. Lubitz 28 joined Germanwings in September 2013 directly after training and had flown 630 hours. Lufthansa chief executive Carsten Spohr described both pilots as ""experienced and trained."" The plane was about halfway through its flight when it descended from a cruising altitude of 38 000 feet to around 6 000 feet in approximately eight minutes. During that time the co-pilot did not respond to radio calls from French air traffic controllers who alerted authorities when the plane disappeared from their radar screens.Overnight AFP reported that one of the cockpit seats was pushed back and the access door opened and closed. Moments later a source told the agency that knocking could be heard but there was no conversation between the pilots. The source added that an alarm warning of the plane's proximity to the ground could be heard just before impact.The New York Times report cited a senior military official involved in the investigation who said the knocking grew increasingly frantic as the Airbus 320 plummeted to earth.""The guy outside is knocking lightly on the door and there is no answer "" the investigator said. ""And then he hits the door stronger and no answer. There is never an answer ... You can hear he is trying to smash the door down.""The Wall Street Journal citing Airbus training materials reported that many Airbus jets are fitted with crew-controlled locks designed to prevent unauthorized access to the flight deck. In some planes the cockpit can be accessed through a keypad code but pilots can also lock out external access for five minutes or longer by flipping a certain switch in the cockpit.The Daily Telegraph citing the German newspaper Bild reported that air traffic controllers had tried three times to contact the plane after a final communication from the captain was received at 10:30 a.m. local time. Seconds later the plane began descending. Bild's report which cited a purported leaked copy of a timeline compiled by the controllers said that attempts were made to contact the plane at 10:31 10:35 and 10:36 with the last two attempts made on the international distress frequency. At 10:40 a.m. the plane vanished from the radar.Remi Jouty the director of France's aviation accident investigation office told reporters Wednesday that investigators had been able to extract sounds and voice from the damaged voice recorder but cautioned ""at this stage we dont have the slightest explanation or interpretation as to what led this plane to fly down.""Officials have not formally ruled out any possible cause of the crash though France's Interior Minister said early Wednesday that he did not believe terrorism was the likely cause ""at the moment."" At his press conference Wednesday Jouty told reporters that the small pieces of debris from the plane indicated that the jet was intact when it hit the ground and did not explode in midair.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Overall we can say many things of the investigation weren't revealed by the investigation at the beginning "" he said.What was mental state of Germanwings co-pilot?Lubitz's depressionLufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr expressed his ""deep sorrow"" Wednesday over the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 and promised to help the victims' families for as long as they need.Speaking as he visited the crash site in the French Alps he said ""There is not a single hour where we don't think about this terrible accident the victims and the relatives and friends of these victims.""We are learning more every day about the cause of the accident but I think it will take a long long time for everybody all of us to understand how this could happen.""Spohr also thanked all those involved in the investigation and recovery efforts as well as local residents for their response to the devastating crash.He added a wreath to the pile of flowers left by grieving families at a simple stone memorial set up in the village of Le Vernet the closest accessible point to the crash site.Lufthansa confirmed Tuesday that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had battled depression years before he took the controls of Germanwings Flight 9525 which he's accused of deliberately crashing last week in the French Alps.Lubitz told his Lufthansa flight training school in 2009 that he had a ""previous episode of severe depression "" the German airline said Tuesday.Investigators: Recovery effort going 'bit by bit' 02:10PLAY VIDEOEmail correspondence between Lubitz and the school discovered in an internal investigation Lufthansa said included medical documents he submitted in connection with resuming his flight training.The announcement indicates that Lufthansa the parent company of Germanwings knew of Lubitz's battle with depression allowed him to continue training and ultimately put him in the cockpit.Germanwings crash compensation: What we knowLufthansa whose CEO Spohr had previously said Lubitz was 100% fit to fly described its statement Tuesday as a ""swift and seamless clarification"" and said it was sharing the information and documents -- including training and medical records -- with public prosecutors.Recovery teams have been working for the past week to recover human remains and plane debris scattered across a steep mountainside.Menichini told CNN late Tuesday that no visible human remains were left at the site but recovery teams would keep searching.French President Francois Hollande speaking Tuesday said that it should be possible to identify all the victims using DNA analysis by the end of the week sooner than authorities had previously suggested.In the meantime the recovery of the victims' personal belongings will start Wednesday Menichini said.Prosecutors: Co-pilot suicidal at one time 03:01PLAY VIDEOCheck out the latest from our correspondentsPossible motive: Fear of losing licenseThe details about Lubitz's correspondence with the flight school during his training were among several developments as investigators continued to delve into what caused the crash and Lubitz's possible motive for downing the jet.A Lufthansa representative told CNN on Tuesday that Lubitz had a valid medical certificate had passed all his examinations and ""held all the licenses required.""Earlier a spokesman for the prosecutor's office in Dusseldorf Germany Christoph Kumpa said medical records reveal Lubitz suffered from suicidal tendencies at some point before his aviation career and underwent psychotherapy before he got his pilot's license.Kumpa emphasized there's no evidence suggesting Lubitz was suicidal or acting aggressively before the crash.Investigators are looking into whether Lubitz feared his medical condition would cause him to lose his pilot's license a European government official briefed on the investigation told CNN on Tuesday.While flying was ""a big part of his life "" the source said it's only one theory being considered.Another source a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation also told CNN that authorities believe the primary motive for Lubitz to bring down the plane was that he feared he would not be allowed to fly because of his medical problems.Lubitz's girlfriend told investigators he had seen an eye doctor and a neuropsychologist both of whom deemed him unfit to work recently and concluded he had psychological issues the European government official said.But no matter what details emerge about his previous mental health struggles there's more to the story said Brian Russell a forensic psychologist.""Psychology can explain why somebody would turn rage inward on themselves about the fact that maybe they weren't going to keep doing their job and they're upset about that and so they're suicidal "" he said. ""But there is no mental illness that explains why somebody then feels entitled to also take that rage and turn it outward on 149 other people who had nothing to do with the person's problems.""Who was the captain of Germanwings Flight 9525?",http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/03/26/more-questions-than-answers-after-report-that-germanwings-pilot-locked-out/ http://us.cnn.com/2015/04/01/europe/france-germanwings-plane-crash-main/index.html12,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/01/20/teen-in-bonnie-and-clyde-crime-spree-abusive-family-was-motive-for-running/,Teen in Bonnie and Clyde crime spree: Abusive family was motive for running,Teen 'Bonnie and Clyde' couple divided in legal fallNever autoplay videosEDITOR'S NOTE: The 13-year-old girl in this story is a minor and will face charges in juvenile court therefore FoxNews.com no longer will identify her.A Kentucky teenager accused of a string of crimes across the South says he and his girlfriend were trying to escape her abusive family and that he wishes he had bought bus tickets instead of stealing trucks as they moved toward Florida.Officials say 18-year-old Dalton Hayes and his girlfriend a 13-year-old girl began their run this month when they vanished from Leitchfield Kentucky.Hayes told The News Herald of Panama City they planned to make it to Miami.

And it should be.Its a unique opportunity for the president to shape the narrative for the next year and his legacy.To this end President Obamas emphasis on the economy and our shrinking deficits bustling industry and booming energy production is the obvious and clear place for him to start.President Obama's speech was out of step with the wishes of the American people and the realities we are facing at home and abroad.But by focusing on his agenda exclusively and not a bipartisan agenda Obama is ignoring the will of the American people who voted Republican in November. This is especially disappointing considering that he pledged in November to work with Congress and to above all else be responsive to the American publics preferences.In his own words the shadow of crisis has passed and the state of the union is strong.Amongst the areas that we are doing well President Obama highlighted the fact that we are creating jobs at fastest pace since 1999 that the unemployment rate lower than before the crisis more Americans are insured than ever before and that we are not dependent on foreign oil for the first time in 30 years.If only the American people felt that way. The speech was out of step with the wishes of the American people and the realities we are facing at home and abroad.New Rasmussen polling numbers show that 61% of voters believe the nation is headed in the wrong direction. So even though we have seen economic growth and an unemployment rate under 6% for months now a lower rate than before the financial crisis yet most Americans still feel squeezed short on money and not optimistic about the future.And theyre afraid. The recent terrorist attacks in Paris on the heels of the hostage situation in Australia and the slew of ISIS beheadings have rattled Americans and for good reason.Over 80% of the electorate believes that there will be a terrorist attack on American soil. And unfortunately in light of what we now have seen is possible in Western nations it is my belief that they may not be wrong.In light of this the presidents claim that we are stopping ISISs advance is not only wrong in real terms but shows an administration that is out of step with American sentiment.I am not an advocate of another ground war. And I am sympathetic to those that are concerned that if we send troops back to the Middle East we will end up with another drawn out conflict.But there is no doubt in my mind and in the minds of many military officials both serving and retired that our approach isnt working.I wrote last week that it was my hope that the president would be specific and focused in this speech. And that it would be specifically focused on our plan to counteract the threat from radical Islam that is very real.Needless to say I didnt get my wish.Further there was almost no talk of policy conciliation in President Obamas speech despite ample opportunity for areas of compromise including immigration reform health care reform debt deficit and fiscal reform as well as tax policy and infrastructure.We heard him reassert his threat to veto any bills that come to his desk that stray from his agenda even while he also argued that policies work as long as politics dont get in the way.Veto threats are politics. Plain and simple.And while the president may have to use his veto power and I do understand it as a presidential right and sometimes an imperative it doesnt help to advance the state of the union as it were.It follows that President Obamas plan for the next two years is to continue down the road that he has been going down for the first six years. He will focus his policies on middle class families and lowering taxes for working families; ensuring that Americans get universal childcare and paid sick leave and that women earn the same as men and that we raise the minimum wage; closing tax loopholes and raising taxes on the rich.These are important goals and policies that by and large I agree with. But redistributionist policies are not the only solutions that are worthwhile to explore.We need to do more and to combine both the Democratic and Republican agenda. And while President Obama ended his speech with the type of language we heard after the midterms we need debate without demonizing each other he said it is still not clear that the president is willing to practice what he preaches.Douglas E.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.Julian Zelizer: Good luck getting it past a Republican CongressJulian ZelizerPresident Obama delivered a tough State of the Union address that offered some solace to Democrats who feared he had given up the fight. Most importantly he put forth a controversial plan to tax wealthier Americans through reforms that close loopholes in order to finance tax cuts for middle class Americans tapping into the populist sentiment that has driven support for politicians like Sen. Elizabeth Warren.Yet Democrats should not get too excited. Speeches can be moving and they certainly can inspire but the situation on Capitol Hill remains dire for proponents of liberal reform. Republicans are in firm control of the House and Senate and the GOP has steadily drifted to the right. Congressional Republicans have proven that they know how to employ procedural tools to obstruct the President's progress.There are almost no indications that Republicans are preparing to do some sudden about face and begin negotiating with the White House. The tax proposal will most likely get stifled in Congress or the president will be forced to trade away the increases on the wealthy and end up simply giving tax cuts to all. Hardly the stuff of progressive politics.The erosion of Democratic strength in Congress since 2010 has been devastating to the party. The Democratic Congress was the driving force behind President Obama's success in his first two years. Even in his most spirited moments the President has found little room to maneuver. The situation is not any different today. In fact it is worse.Republicans are also ready for a fight and with control of Congress they'll be able to hit back hard.Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of the new book ""The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson Congress and the Battle for the Great Society.""---------------Maria Cardona: Can GOP meet him halfway?Maria CardonaTuesday night the President delivered a speech that was strong bold and inspirational. He challenged the Republican Party but was conciliatory as well. It should have been called the Audacity of Progress. With a new pep in his step and rising poll numbers President Obama finally talked more freely -- more assertively -- about the economic progress that has been slowly revealing itself to the nation over the past several months.More importantly he described how the middle class can partake of that progress; he laid out sensible proposals and tools that the middle class can use-- tripling the Child Care Tax Credit giving $500 tax credit to couples that work offering paid sick leave helping families pay down a mortgage and incentivizing workers to save for retirement.Many of these are proposals have had GOP support in the past. Can the Republicans finally put politics aside and prove to the nation they have more in their legislative vocabulary than just ""no?"" Will they reject their well-known yet destructive path -- that of a party that puts middle class voters those who need the most aside and fights for those at the very top who need the least?The President laid out the Audacity of Progress and an agenda for the future. For the sake of the nation and the survival of their own party Republicans should have the audacity to at least meet him halfway.Maria Cardona is a political commentator for CNN a Democratic strategist and principal at the Dewey Square Group.

What a strange man President Obama can be. His party has suffered a historic defeat in the midterm elections Islamist terrorism is on the march and his approval ratings remain unimpressive. And yet Obama's speech suggested that he was on top of the world. Celebrating mocking the opposition making promises well beyond his capacity to deliver and even pledging to colonize Mars. It was a good speech well delivered. But it was also pure fantasy.The economy is not as good as he suggested: the labor force participation rate has fallen to a 36-year low. He wallowed in the suffering of the Russian people thanks to sanctions and then cheered the normalization of relations with Cuba -- one contradiction among many.Another example of his ability to inhabit two positions at once came when he first appealed for a new nicer politics and then in an unscripted remark reminded the Republicans that he'd won two presidential elections.But his memory wasn't so great on some issues. The President celebrated gay marriage as a story of freedom and a ""civil right."" Yet he was opposed to it until just before the last election. And while he reasserted the need for men and women to be paid the same wages at the White House differentials persist.We all know that Obama is a good speaker and yes this was a fine speech. But it had elements of self-delusion. The people with the real power are the Republicans. And they won't let Obama treat the next two years like some vain victory lap.Timothy Stanley is a historian and columnist for Britain's Daily Telegraph. He is the author of the new book ""Citizen Hollywood: How the Collaboration Between L.A. and D.C. Revolutionized American Politics.""------------Frida Ghitis: In denial on foreign policyIf only President Obama had as valid a reason to gloat about progress on foreign policy as he did on the domestic economy! The president's boasts about success beyond America's borders rang hollow.""I believe in a smarter kind of American leadership "" he said explaining his strategic calculus.Just hours before Obama spoke Iran-backed rebels launched a coup against the U.S.-backed president of Yemen just on Saudi Arabia's doorstep. Obama did not talk about that of course. The reality and Obama knows it is that the global situation is dire and it has grown much worse since he took office.The festering wound at the center of the greatest failure of the Obama administration suppurates from Syria. After promising and repeating his promise to arm moderate rebels the administration has acted timidly and the result is disaster across the Middle East spreading to Iraq reverberating in the streets of Paris Sydney Ottawa and elsewhere.More than three years after he declared that Syrian President ""Assad must go "" the crisis has metastasized. Today international conflicts have left more than 50 million people as refugees the highest number since World War II. Obama managed to brag about Iraq a state that nearly spiraled out of existence in recent months as ISIS forces captured its second biggest city and continued their march capturing large swaths of the country.On Iran's nuclear program Obama's strongest words targeted members of Congress considering new sanctions which he vowed to veto.And Obama took credit for the Russian economy's collapse although it is low oil prices that are hurting Vladimir Putin's Russia more than U.S. policies. In fact the drop in oil will help U.S. foreign policy more than anything.Obama can take credit for improving relations with Cuba and Burma. But claiming that his presidency has succeeded on the foreign policy front is simply incorrect. He still has two more years to show results -- for the things about which he is already boasting.Frida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review.

Someone needs to tell him that his party no longer controls even one house in Congress -- let alone both as was the case in 2009 to 2011.In his seventh State of the Union address Obama was as bold and audacious as ever. He spent the first part of the speech bragging about how his administration had singlehandedly saved the country from prolonged war decaying values and economic ruin and the second part laying out a wish list for what he believes still needs to be done in the remaining two years of his presidency to complete the salvation.Normally Americans might find this sort of thing refreshing -- i.e. a leader so committed to his principles that he won't waver in the policies even in the face of growing political opposition.Yet that's not how this drama comes across. It's not refreshing. It's ridiculous. The President has just suffered a clear repudiation of his policies and instead of backing up and recalibrating his strategy for getting things done in a landscape that has changed dramatically he's doubling down on his bet. That's not leadership. It's hubris. And sadly the latter is often incompatible with the former.Ruben Navarrette is a CNN contributor and a nationally syndicated columnist with the Washington Post Writers Group.

As we heard President Obama say ""At this moment -- with a growing economy shrinking deficits bustling industry and booming energy production -- we have risen from recession freer to write our own future than any other nation on Earth. It's now up to us to choose who we want to be over the next 15 years and for decades to come.""What we also saw clearly was that Democrats and Republicans have two very different ideas about what we want that future to look like.This country has tried trickle-down economics and it failed leaving many Americans behind with policies that favored the richest among us. Economic policies that are rooted in the middle class work and they ensure that everyone is able to benefit from this recovery. But still Republicans continue to fight for only those at the very top and big corporations which coincidentally are in line with their own financial and political self-interest.While the President offered his vision for the country -- expanding opportunity -- where ""everyone gets a fair shot everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same set of rules "" Republicans have shown time and again that they aren't interested in fighting for shared opportunity for all. Just look at their striking refusal tonight to applaud things like access to education affordable child care or paid sick leave.The President has one more SOTU to deliver. Let's hope that next year both parties will find something to cheer about with regards to an improving economy for all.-------------Aaron David Miller: Still risk-averse in a dangerous worldAaron David MillerUnfortunately a President who'd like to focus on the middle class can't escape the Middle East.Unlike last year's State of the Union speech in which the President declared that ""America must move off a permanent war footing "" this time he couldn't downplay the challenges that America faces in the broken angry dysfunctional Middle East. Recent jihadi terror attacks and plots in France and Belgium; the Houthi takeover of much of Yemen (which President Obama had held up as a model of counterterrorism last September); and ISIS's successes in Syria and Iraq simply wouldn't allow it.But make no mistake. When it comes to the Middle East this President remains broadly risk-averse. His remarks on foreign policy were more about continuity than change.Sure the President proposed to negotiate a new Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF) with Congress. But if the language in tonight's speech is an indication such a new authorization will be quite consistent with what the United States is already doing -- training and equipping local allies and relying on air power rather than large numbers of U.S. forces.Sure he talked tough on combating jihadi terrorists. But he will do this through what the President called ""smart leadership "" i.e. focused counterterrorism instead of his predecessor's nation-building and deployment of thousands of ground forces .And sure he's rightly proud of the tough sanctions regime that brought Iran to the negotiating table on its nuclear program. But as he indicated tonight he'll resist any congressional effort on new sanctions let alone force until it's clear that diplomacy has failed.Rhetoric notwithstanding the President remains extricator-in-chief -- determined to reduce America's Middle East profile and to get the U.S. out of long and profitless old wars into new ones.Aaron David Miller is a vice president and distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and was a Middle East negotiator in Democratic and Republican administrations.

He was powerfully confident deeply optimistic and relentlessly proudly progressive. He justly saluted our troops bringing both parties to their feet. But from there he drove hard at an economic agenda beloved by Democrats and loathed by Republicans. He declared that ""the verdict is clear. Middle class economics works. Expanding opportunity works. And these policies will continue to work as long as politics don't get in the way.""The President put the GOP on their heels pushing an agenda targeted at the heart of the middle class - especially those working women who are the base of his party: tax fairness child care maternity leave pay equity raising the minimum wage and reducing the cost of community college ""to zero.""With millions of new jobs gas below $2.50 a gallon wages finally starting to rise and the deficit falling America has regained its mojo.

That was the message at the heart of President Obama's surprisingly moving State of the Union speech last night. He laid out his policy priorities yet he did so while appealing to the ""basic decency of American values not our basic fears."" He could have taken an in-your-face victory gap given his rising poll numbers and favorable economic news.Instead he showed grace as he laid out his vision for the next two years. He even tailored parts of his message to appeal to conservative talking points -- noting that he wanted all Americans to contribute to and share in our country's success.Cuba was the country that merited the most mentions in tonight's speech and Obama's mention of his administration restoring diplomatic ties there drew some of the loudest applause of the night. The President laid it out so simply: ""When what you're doing doesn't work for 50 years it's time to do something new.""The contrast between his willingness to forge greater connection with the Cuban people contrasted sharply with the TV images of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) glowering in his seat. Nor did the president miss the chance to remind Congress that it should begin the work of ending the embargo -- a position supported by a clear majority of Americans.Most impressively the president touched on our country's most contentious issues -- immigration women's reproductive rights and race relations -- by noting that they had the potential to be unifying issues. This was as personally inspiring as it was politically masterful. The President stood strong in his belief that we are indeed the United States.Raul A. Reyes is an attorney and member of the USA Today Board of Contributors. Follow him on Twitter @RaulAReyesLZ Granderson: Emboldened and delivering good newsPresident Obama delivered arguably his best State of the Union address since the first one he made. It was not only passionate but it delivered moments of humor and more importantly -- good news. For the first time he said ""the State of the Union is strong"" something many Americans are still slow to feel and Democratic candidates in November failed to bring up.The unemployment rate is down more than 150 000 American troops are home and 10 million more Americans have health insurance than did when Obama took office. He was optimistic and he had the metrics to support it especially on his domestic policy. And while no one believes all of the proposals he outlined will fly unharmed through the new Republican Congress there appeared to be enough bipartisan morsels mentioned to challenge the idea that the two parties won't get anything done.Like trade. Like getting new authorization to use force against ISIS. Like legislation to encourage companies to hire veterans. But the crowning moments of his speech were the last three minutes or so. This is when Obama showed again the man who won the presidency and re-election in historic fashion.He defended religious freedom and included Muslims in that conversation. He repeatedly spoke about equality for LGBT people and pointed out 7 out of 10 Americans live in states where same-sex marriage is legal. He brought up the racial tension in Ferguson the concern for safety with our police force and again replaced the notion of a red America and a blue America with one of the United States of America -- something he did when he first burst onto the scene in 2004 at the Democrat National Convention in Boston.At the end I found myself asking ""Didn't the Democrats lose in November?"" Wasn't Obama rebuked in an election where the Senate flipped from Democratic to Republican?And yet there he was. Confident. Emboldened. Optimistic. Something we haven't seen in quite some time. But then again the country has not had some of the positive economic numbers it currently boasts in quite some time either. Democrats in November fumbled the good domestic news. Obama in January did not.LZ Granderson is a CNN contributor a senior writer for ESPN and a lecturer at Northwestern University.

Terror group seizes Iraqi town 5 miles from Marine base,"ISIS advancing in Iraq's Anbar provinceNever autoplay videosIslamic State has reportedly seized al-Baghdadi in Iraqs Anbar Province 5 miles from an air base staffed by U.S. Marines as the terror group continues its push beyond its bases in Syria and Iraq in an attempt to establish militant affiliates in other countries.Hundreds of Islamic State fighters reportedly captured most of al-Baghdadi which is 55 miles from the capital Ramadi on Thursday.On Friday Iraqi soldiers had retaken several government buildings but the soldiers withdrew early Saturday handing the town back to the militants The New York Times reported citing local security officials.One local Iraqi official told Reuters that ""Ninety percent of al-Baghdadi district has fallen under the control of the insurgents.""Militants attacked the town of al-Baghdadi from two directions before advancing inward Reuters reported.According to the Pentagon al-Baghdadi was the first territorial gain by the militant group in months.On Friday following the attack on al-Baghdadi Islamic state fighters led a suicide attack on the Ayn al-Asad air base where U.S. Marines are training Iraqi troops.Most of the Islamic State fighters died in the suicide attack killed either by Iraqi government forces or by detonating their suicide vests said Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby the Pentagon spokesman.Kirby said an estimated 20-25 Islamic State militants were involved in the attack on al-Asad air base in Iraq's Anbar province. He said the attack was led by ""at least several"" suicide bombers some of whom managed to detonate their bombs while others were killed by Iraqi troops.It appeared that most if not all of the militants were wearing Iraqi uniforms Kirby said.No Iraqi or U.S. troops were killed or wounded Kirby said and no U.S. troops were involved in the gunfight.This isn't the flu Rep. Peter King R-N.Y. told Greta Van Susteren during On The Record Friday. The fact is those 300 Marines [at al-Asad] are the toughest guys around. And they are well-armed. But the fact that the ISIS attack today didn't work doesn't mean that it couldn't work in the future said King.We have been given a warning signal and we must take action.- Air Force Lt. Gen. Tom McInerneyAir Force Lt. Gen. Tom McInerney says the United States must use force in the area seizing control of the key roads Islamic State also known as ISIS will need to continue its march toward the capital.We have been given a warning signal and we must take action McInerney (Ret.) told Fox News Sunday. The best defense is a good offense.A Defense Department spokeswoman confirmed to Fox News that heavy fighting took place in the area on Thursday but referred questions about the status of al-Baghdadi to the Iraqi government.There was no direct attack on the al-Asad air base the spokeswoman assured while acknowledging reports of ineffective indirect fire in the vicinity of the base.The area in Anbar Province has long been a hot zone of fighting as ISIS looks to hold and expand its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria. In January the Pentagon first confirmed that U.S. troops at the Al Asad base had been coming under regular mortar fire.To date those attacks have been described as ineffective. A senior U.S. official told Fox News the base receives low-scale indirect fire from time to time.We continue to support efforts by Iraqi Security Forces working in conjunction with tribal fighters directed against ISIL in the province the DOD spokeswoman said Thursday.Another Pentagon spokesman Col. Steven Warren said the U.S. troops were about 2 miles away in a different section of the base.According to The Times American intelligence officials estimate that the terror groups fighters have reached as many as 31 000 in Syria and Iraq.U.S. unmanned surveillance aircraft and Army Apache attack helicopters were sent to the scene from Baghdad but the attack was over before they arrived so they did not engage in fighting Warren said.There are currently nearly 2 600 U.S. forces in Iraq. Of those about 450 are training Iraqi troops at three bases across the country including al-Asad.Forces from other coalition countries conduct the training at the fourth site in the northern city of Irbil.The development comes as the U.S.-led coalition continues to launch airstrikes against ISIS with Jordan taking on a greater role following the brutal execution of a captured Jordanian pilot at ISIS hands.Fox News Lucas Tomlinson contributed to this report.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

The tweet on the same one that previously posted the countdown clock warned that a new video was ""being sent to production."" Intelligence sources told Fox News the claim the hostages had been killed could not be confirmed but said the situation is being monitored as they await release of a new video. In a video released Tuesday Kenji Goto a journalist and Haruna Yukawa who runs a security company were threatened with beheading by the barbaric terror organization if the Japanese government did not pay the staggering on ransom. The video posted on militant websites and identified as being made by the Islamic State group's al-Furqan media arm appeared to have been shot in the same location as those showing American hostages James Foley Steven Sotloff and Peter Kassig and British captives David Haines and Alan Henning.Japan has said it is working to free the hostages but has not stated whether it would pay the ransom. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe convened his National Security Council to discuss how to handle the crisis.The hostage video showing the hostages wearing orange jump suits and kneeling before a masked black-clad jihadist may have been faked experts said. New analysis of the video appears to reveal the message was shot indoors using a ""green screen "" and a phony backdrop according to Veryan Khan editorial director for the Terrorism Research and Analysis Consortium. She told The Associated Press the light source on the men in the latest videos appears to be coming from two different directions as opposed to one bright sun and said if the video was made outdoors in natural light the shadows behind them should be going in one direction. Instead they converge.""The hostages are visibly bothered by"" the bright light she said.""My son is not an enemy of the Islamic State.""- Mother of 47-year-old journalist Kenji GotoAlthough one of the hostage's jumpsuits flutters in a breeze Khan said she believes a fan caused the movement and noted that wind in the desert would be noisy and affect the sound quality of the statements being made by the knife-wielding man. It would also kick up dust and none seems apparent she said.Experts poring over the slickly-produced videos believe they were made in an area south of Raqqa in northern Syria the self-declared capital of the Islamic State group. The killings of the five other hostages took place between August and November. The U.S.-led coalition began targeting IS militants in Syria in mid-September and has gradually intensified its aerial bombardment of suspected IS infrastructure in both Syria and Iraq.Jan. 20 2015: This image taken from an online video released by the Islamic State's al-Furqan media arm purports to show the group threatening to kill two Japanese hostages that the militants identify as Kenji Goto Jogo left and Haruna Yukawa right unless a $200 million ransom is paid within 72 hours.

Two Japanese who said they have contacts with an ISIS leader offered Thursday to try to negotiate but it was unclear if the Japanese government was receptive to the idea.Ishido said she had not had any contact with the government.Government spokesman Yoshihide Suga reiterated Friday that Japan was trying all possible channels to reach those holding the hostages and that its policy of providing humanitarian aid for those displaced by conflict in the Middle East was unchanged.""We are doing our very best to coordinate with related parties including through tribal chiefs "" Suga said. Japan has joined other major industrial nations of the Group of Seven in opposing ransom payments. U.S. and British officials also said they advised against paying.Tokyo lacks strong diplomatic connections in the Middle East and Japanese diplomats left Syria as the civil war there escalated adding to the difficulty of contacting the group holding the hostages.There was no sign the government had taken action on an offer to try to negotiate with ISIS by Ko Nakata an expert on Islamic law and former professor at Kyoto's Doshisha University along with freelance journalist Kousuke Tsuneoka.Jan. 23: Militants affiliated with the Islamic State group have posted an online warning that the ""countdown has begun"" for the group to kill a pair of Japanese hostages. (AP)Nakata and Tsuneoka who both are converts to Islam said Thursday that they have a contact in ISIS and were prepared to go to Syria.Nakata and Tsuneoka who was released after being held hostage in Afghanistan in 2010 visited Syria in September in an unsuccessful attempt to gain Yukawa's release. Goto was seized sometime after late October when he entered the area.Since Japan's military operates only in a self-defense capacity a home any rescue attempt would require help from an ally like the United States.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

A couple and a young girl were reportedly found dead in the home on Saturday. Police are investigating to see if the case is connected to the shooting death of a young man in Baltimore on Saturday. (AP)CORBIN Ky.  Friends and relatives of a 16-year-old boy killed in a shootout with police in Maryland struggled to understand how the faithful churchgoer and high school ROTC student could end up as the suspect in the slaying of his parents and younger sister in Kentucky.Jason Hendrix was suspected of killing his family execution-style last week before fleeing his small Southern town to the East Coast authorities said Sunday.Saturday's shootout led police to search the teen's home more than 500 miles away in Corbin Kentucky. There authorities found the bodies of Kevin and Sarah Hendrix and their daughter Grace about age 12 Corbin Police Chief David Campbell said.Police said they believe the victims were gunned down Wednesday afternoon Campbell said. Jason Hendrix then fled in his parent's car armed with four weapons and a backpack full of ammunition Campbell added.""Right now all the evidence points toward him as being the shooter "" the chief said.Police didn't know why the suspect decided to flee to the East Coast. The family had no relatives in Baltimore Campbell said.""We have no clue why he went up there "" the chief said. Police also found a gas receipt showing that the teen had been in New Jersey on Thursday.Baltimore County Police said the teenager shot and wounded a police officer Saturday after crashing the parent's green Honda Pilot into a silver sedan. At least six officers opened fire on Hendrix who was pronounced dead at the scene. Maryland State Police said they initially sought to pull Hendrix over Saturday for a speeding violation.Campbell said the teenager was angry at his parents for taking away his computer privileges days before the slayings. ""The mother had talked to a co-worker and told her that he was really mad about that "" the chief said.The father wearing a sport coat and tie from work was shot twice in the head Campbell said. He added that the mother was shot twice in the face and the girl twice in the head and once in the arm.Jason Hendrix met up with friends at church that Wednesday evening and showed no signs of distress. ""They said he was just like he usually is "" Campbell said.Family and friends in Corbin sought Sunday to understand the series of events recalling a teenager known for his politeness.Kevin and Sarah Hendrix were beekeepers who sold honey in the local farmers market and Grace Hendrix was a middle school cheerleader. A spokesman for Union College in Barbourville confirmed Sarah Hendrix was a professor at the school.Drew Mahan the founding pastor of Forward Community Church where the Hendrixes attended said officers questioned him extensively about Jason on Saturday night after discovering the bodies. He described Jason Hendrix as a faithful member of his 3-year-old church which holds services at a local movie theater.Hendrix would arrive at the theater every Sunday at 7 a.m. to help set up the church's equipment and was baptized at a service in December.""People want to ask questions.

Hernandez is accused of murdering semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd. A jury is expected to be seated for opening arguments in his murder trial as early as Tuesday Jan. 27 2015. Judge Susan Garsh had cleared 53 potential jurors after individually questioning them to weed out people who are biased have a hardship or have a valid reason to be excused. Lawyers from both sides will have the chance to eliminate 18 people each from the final pool on Monday for any reason. Eighteen jurors will be seated. (AP Photo/Brian Snyder Pool File) (The Associated Press)FALL RIVER Mass.  Aaron Hernandez once seemed to be a man with a bright future. At age 23 he had a Super Bowl appearance under his belt and a $40 million contract as a star tight end with the New England Patriots. He and his fiancee had started a family living in a mansion in the Boston suburbs with their 8-month-old daughter.This week prosecutors will paint a different picture of Hernandez: they will portray him as a killer who orchestrated the shooting of semiprofessional football player Odin Lloyd.Hernandez was arrested days after Lloyd's bullet-riddled body was found in an industrial park near his North Attleborough mansion. He has pleaded not guilty and after more than two weeks of jury selection his trial is expected to kick off in earnest this week with opening statements.The case will be laid out in the courtroom just as Hernandez's old team prepares for Sunday's Super Bowl the Patriots' first appearance since 2012 when Hernandez caught a touchdown pass in Super Bowl XLVI. The Patriots cut him less than two hours after he was arrested.Hernandez now 25 is also charged with killing two men in Boston in 2012 because he felt disrespected after one of them spilled a drink on him at a nightclub. He pleaded not guilty after being charged in those shootings in May and the case has not yet gone to trial.Lloyd 27 played for the Boston Bandits football team and was dating the sister of Shayanna Jenkins Hernandez's fiancee. Prosecutors say he and Hernandez were friendly and had been at a nightclub together a couple of days before he was killed.Prosecutors have said Hernandez and two friends from his hometown of Bristol Connecticut picked up Lloyd at his home in Boston's Dorchester section around 2:30 a.m. on June 17 2013. Those men Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace have also pleaded not guilty to murder charges and will be tried separately.From Dorchester prosecutors say the four men drove to North Attleborough in a rented Nissan Altima stopping along the way to buy bubble gum at a gas station. An hour after he left his house prosecutors say Lloyd was dead shot multiple times by a .45-caliber Glock. They have not said who pulled the trigger but say Hernandez orchestrated the killing. The murder weapon has never been found.Prosecutors have said toll booth video surveillance GPS and cellphone records clearly place Hernandez in the car with Lloyd at the time of his murder and have said video from the security system inside Hernandez's own home shows him walking through his house with a gun minutes after the killing.Christopher Dearborn a professor at Suffolk University Law School says that while the Bristol County District Attorney's office has a lot of circumstantial evidence its challenge is to offer a motive to jurors. Prosecutors have said a possible motive was that Hernandez may have showed Lloyd the spot where the 2012 shooting took place. But Bristol County Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh last month ruled they may not introduce anything having to do with the 2012 killing in the Lloyd murder trial.The lack of a clear motive is the biggest weakness in the prosecution's case Dearborn said.""You need to give a jury a reason why or they're going to have pause "" Dearborn said. ""I don't think they have a motive that they can present in concrete fashion with witnesses that can support a motive.""Hernandez's legal team is likely to focus on the holes Dearborn said.""We don't have a weapon. We don't have a confession. We don't have eyewitnesses "" he said.Hernandez's team does not have to offer a defense or explanation or even deliver an opening statement. But Dearborn said he expects to hear one.""They will absolutely have to have their own narrative "" he said. ""That narrative will probably suggest alternatives.""Jenkins Hernandez's fiancee has been charged with perjury for allegedly lying to a grand jury including when she said she could not remember what she did with a box prosecutors believe she disposed of after getting what they called a coded message from Hernandez. She has pleaded not guilty.In the run-up to the trial Jenkins was often seen in court and the judge this month granted a request from Hernandez's legal team that she be allowed to attend the trial to support him even though she is listed as a potential prosecution witness.But two days before the trial began the district attorney petitioned the judge to grant Jenkins immunity which would compel her to testify. The court has not said yet whether it was granted.Jenkins has not been seen in the courtroom since.",http://us.cnn.com/2015/01/30/us/massachusetts-aaron-hernandez-trial/index.html,Judge to Aaron Hernandez jury: Enjoy Super Bowl but be vigilant,"Story highlightsJudge closes Day Two of Aaron Hernandez murder trial with a warningOdin Lloyd's girlfriend testifies that victim and Hernandez were not closeFormer New England Patriots tight end has pleaded not guilty in the death of Lloyd(CNN)To watch or not to watch.That is the question for 12 jurors and six alternates in the Massachusetts murder trial of former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez when the region's beloved Patriots play in Super Bowl XLIX on Sunday.On a day in which the girlfriend of victim Odin Lloyd took the stand and Lloyd's mother again left the courtroom in tears Bristol County Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh on Friday had a warning for the jury.""I am not going to forbid you from watching the Super Bowl if that's something that's really important to you "" she said.But the judge closed the second day of testimony by advising jurors to be vigilant for mention of Hernandez who helped lead the Patriots to Super Bowl XLVI nearly three years ago.""You hear that word you've got to walk out of the room "" Garsh said.

Hernandez was angry when he left the club.The defense said the one-time NFL star worth $40 million was targeted by police and prosecutors in the death of the semipro football player because of celebrity status.Hernandez ""never had a chance"" as authorities zeroed in Fee told the jury.Fee sought to plant doubt in the jury saying police went after Hernandez from the start.""As soon as they found out Aaron Hernandez -- a celebrity football player for the New England Patriots -- was a friend of Odin Lloyd's it was over "" he said.The prosecution will try to ""dazzle and distract you"" with the fruits of an investigation that was ""sloppy and unprofessional "" Fee said.The case against his client is ""just a story and it's not true "" he added.The prosecutors will argue that Lloyd's killing was a ""joint venture."" Under Massachusetts state law prosecutors don't necessarily have to prove who pulled the trigger. Under joint venture anyone who actively participates in a killing can be found guilty according to legal experts.On June 16 2013 Lloyd was riding with friends in a black Chevrolet Suburban which police later learned was rented by Hernandez.Close friend Daryl Hodge was with Lloyd when he said Lloyd got a text from Hernandez asking to hang out later that night.Former NFL player charged with murder 02:51PLAY VIDEOAs they parted ways Lloyd told Hodge he'd see him later.Lloyd's body was found the next day.The judge has blocked any mention that Hernandez was indicted in connection with two other killings in Boston.

(AP Photo/Mark Humphrey)The NFL's investigation into whether the New England Patriots used deliberately under-inflated footballs against the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Championship game has focused on a locker room attendant at the Patriots' stadium.Fox Sports reported Monday that the attendant could be seen on surveillance video bringing 12 balls supplied by the Patriots for use on offense into another room at Gillette Stadium after a pregame inspection by the game officials. Under NFL rules each team must present their chosen footballs to the game officials for inspection and approval two hours and fifteen minutes before the start of each game.Fox Sports also reported that the attendant was interviewed by NFL investigators last week as part of their investigation. It has not been determined whether any wrongdoing took place. The NFL has said that balls provided by the Patriots for the game against the Colts were underinflated though it is not clear why. League rules mandate that game balls must be inflated to a minimum of 12.5 pounds per square inch and a maximum of 13.5 pounds per square inch. The Patriots defeated the Indianapolis Colts 45-7 in the AFC title game Jan. 18 to advance to their sixth Super Bowl since 2001. NFL Executive Vice President Jeff Pash and Ted Wells of the law firm of Paul Weiss are leading the probe. Wells was the lead investigator into the Miami Dolphins bullying scandal involving offensive linemen Richie Incognito and Jonathan Martin.Later Monday Patriots owner Robert Kraft said that he hoped the NFL would apologize to his team if the league's investigation failed to find any wrongdoing.

She is a national lecturer on sports entertainment and women's topics and a recipient of the 2010 Woman of the Year award from Women in Sports and Events. She is the co-author of ""Say It Loud: An Illustrated History of the Black Athlete"" and CEO of the Push Marketing Group. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.(CNN)It turns out there's a pesky little gremlin lurking around in the Patriots equipment room deflating footballs. Mystery solved. We should have known all along there was a logical explanation for the ""Deflategate"" scandal gripping the Sport Nation.That's pretty much what New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and his coach Bill Belichick would have us believe after their less-than illuminating press conferences yesterday. Both men claimed they were just as stumped as us over how exactly 11 out of 12 of the team's footballs used AFC Championship game against Indianapolis had been illegally deflated below regulation specs.Roxanne Jones""When I came in Monday morning I was shocked to learn of the news reports about the footballs. I had no knowledge whatsoever of the situation "" said a famously crotchety Belichick. ""I was completely totally unaware of anything.""His quarterback appearing equally puzzled wanted everyone to know that he's no cheater: ""I would never do anything to break the rules. I believe in fair play. I have no knowledge of anything ... no knowledge of any wrongdoing ... I don't know what happened.""Really Tom? It's hard to believe -- almost laughable really -- that Brady who is in his 15th NFL season with six trips to the Super Bowl and three Super Bowl wins noticed nothing wrong. This is a guy who's known to micromanage every aspect of the game including the ball. And he's on record saying he prefers a soft football. How could a pro like this notice nothing wrong?The NFL which according to ESPN reports had been put on notice by the Colts going into the AFC Championship game that the Patriots may have used ""soft balls"" earlier in the season said it is conducting a full investigation But with the Super Bowl less than two weeks away we've heard nothing from them nor apparently has Brady he said yesterday.So it's easy to understand why fans and even pro athletes are not buying Brady's story:""It's obvious that Tom Brady had something to do with this "" said Hall of Fame QB Troy Aikman on his Dallas radio program even before the Brady-Belichick press conferences. ""So for the balls to be deflated that doesn't happen unless the quarterback wants that to happen I can assure you of that. Now the question becomes: Did Bill Belichick know about it.""The evidence is clear: Eleven of the team's balls were illegally deflated and they didn't get there by themselves. All the talk about cold weather being the culprit? Forget it. Not only was the temperature in the 50s on game day but if weather was a factor then the Colts' game balls would have also deflated. That didn't happen.Brady always the polished pitchman is playing the innocent victim role perfectly. Perhaps this is all just a conspiracy put out there by Patriots haters Brady suggested yesterday. Good try but most reasonable people do not believe in conspiracy theories. And hopefully even fewer people believe in invisible gremlins. So there must be another explanation.That leaves the Deflategate spectacle in the hands of NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. The scandal has provided plenty of jokes for late-night television and Twitter. But cheating in the NFL a $9.5 billion a year industry with an overall market value of $46 billion for its 32 teams is no laughing matter.It's been a rough year for the integrity of the game. Goodell has admittedly made botched calls over several cases involving domestic abuse with the Ray Rice scandal being the most egregious. And this season has been littered with debatable play-calling in crucial game situations.This is no time for stalled investigations. A ruling on Deflategate after the Super Bowl would be a huge letdown and signal that cheating no matter how blatant is no big deal in the NFL. Goodell should act swiftly and announce sanctions against New England before the Super Bowl takes place in Phoenix on Feburary 1. Fans are not the only ones calling for the commissioner to clean this mess up.Earlier this week Nevada Sen. Dean Heller called on Goodell to restore the credibility of the game. ""I am seeking decisive actions ensuring all teams are playing according to the rules "" Heller said in a statement. He recommended the league work with the NFL Players Association to resolve the issue ahead before the Super Bowl.Let's be clear: The Patriots are second-time offenders when it comes to cheating. Back in 2007 Belichick was fined the NFL maximum of $500 000 and the Patriots were ordered to pay $250 000 for spying on an opponent's (The New York Jets) defensive signals. In the end the team's assistant video guy took the fall and was the only person fired in the incident. The Pats also lost a draft pick in 2008.""This episode represents a calculated and deliberate attempt to avoid long-standing rules designed to encourage fair play and promote honest competition on the playing field "" Goodell said at the time in a letter to the Patriots.Goodell got it right back then: He handed out the biggest fine ever for an NFL coach and he sent a clear message that cheating would not be tolerated or excused away. This time around despite the billions of dollars attached to the Super Bowl Goodell needs to go further. At a minimum the commissioner should:-- Disqualify the Patriots from the Super Bowl-- Strip the team's AFC Championship title-- Fine or suspend Belichick who despite his claims to the contrary should have known about the deflated balls -- and even if he didn't he's ultimately responsible for everything that happens on the field.And if it can reasonably be argued that Brady knew or should have known based on his NFL expertise that the football has been tampered with then he too should face tough sanctions.Since there's no precedent for disqualifying a Super Bowl team Goodell would have to put a plan in place. It makes sense to me that the next best AFC team would go instead of the Pats which means the Colts would play.And no it doesn't matter that New England beat Indy 45-7. The score is not the point when a team cheats. And if winning -- by any means necessary -- is really all that matters these days in the NFL then we might as well throw out the rule books and stop preaching about the ""sanctity of the game.""It's 2015 and it seems the Patriots still think the rules don't apply to them. They haven't learned their lesson. This time around the commissioner must send an even stronger message so there's no confusion.The Patriots should be benched for Super Bowl XLIX.(Note: An earlier version of this article listed the wrong opponent to the Patriots in the AFC Championship game.)Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine.Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.",21,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/01/29/new-isis-ultimatum-to-jordan-release-iraqi-woman-by-sundown-or-pilot-dies/,Deadline for possible prisoner swap passes as Jordan asks ISIS for proof that pilot is alive,"Will Jordan terror swap only strengthen ISIS?Never autoplay videosThe fate of a Japanese journalist and Jordanian military pilot held by the Islamic State terror group remains unclear as the sun set in Iraq marking the passage of a new deadline for a possible swap involving a female Iraqi prisoner.A spokesman said Thursday that Jordan's government has demanded proof of life of a Jordanian pilot held by Islamic State militants before moving ahead with any swap to bring about his release.The militants have purportedly threatened to kill the pilot Lt. Muath al-Kaseasbeh by sunset unless Jordan frees an Iraqi woman from death row and delivers her to the Turkish border.The woman Sajida al-Rishawi was involved in deadly Amman hotel bombings a decade ago.Jordanian government spokesman Mohammed al-Momani said Thursday afternoon that al-Rishawi is still in Jordan raising doubts that the sunset deadline would be met. He said ""we want to see a proof of life of the Jordanian pilot and then we can talk about the exchange.""A new message posted online late Wednesday read in English by a voice likely that of hostage Kenji Goto according to the Japanese government was released after Jordan offered to hand over the Al Qaeda-linked would-be suicide bomber to the Islamic State group in exchange for al-Kaseasbeh.""I am Kenji Goto. This is a voice message I've been told to send to you. If Sajida al-Rishawi is not ready for exchange for my life at the Turkish border by Thursday sunset 29th of January Mosul (Iraq) time the Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kasaesbeh will be killed immediately "" the voice on the recording says. The recording did not specify what Goto's fate would be if al-Rishawi was not released. Sunset in Mosul Iraq is estimated to occur at 5:30 p.m. local time Thursday (9:30 a.m. ET).Al-Rishawi has close family ties to the Iraqi branch of the Al Qaeda terror network that became the forerunner of the Islamic State group also known as ISIS. She has never explained why she strapped an explosives belt to her waist and along with her husband who also wore a bomb walked into the luxury Radisson hotel in the Jordanian capital of Amman on Nov. 9 2005. Her husband set off his bomb ripping through a wedding party with 300 guests in the ballroom but al-Rishawi's explosives failed to go off.The bombing was one of three near-simultaneous attacks on Amman hotels on that day and killed 60 people in Jordan's worst ever terror attack. The Iraq branch of Al Qaeda claimed responsibility.Jordan's government said on Wednesday that it had not received any assurance that al-Kasaesbeh was alive and would only complete the exchange if he was freed as well according to Reuters. Earlier Wednesday government spokesman Mohammed al-Momani announced that Jordan was willing to trade al-Rishawi for the pilot but made no mention of Goto. To secure release of the hostages Jordan reportedly is holding indirect talks with the militants through religious and tribal leaders in Iraq.The latest recording was distributed via Islamic State-affiliated Twitter accounts and could not be immediately verified. The Japanese government said Thursday that it was studying the latest message but did not immediately confirm its authenticity.""We think there is a high probability that this is Mr. Goto's voice "" government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said. He added that the government was in close communications and ""deeply trusts"" Jordans government. He said Japan was doing its utmost to free Goto working with nations in the region including Turkey Jordan and Israel.Suga refused comment on the specifics of the talks with Jordan saying the situation was developing. Japans cabinet met to assess the latest developments but did not issue any updates.Efforts to free al-Kaseasbeh and Goto gained urgency after a purported online ultimatum claimed Tuesday that ISIS would kill both hostages within 24 hours if Jordan did not free al-Rishawi.Japan has scrambled to deal with the crisis that began last week with the release of a video by ISIS showing Goto and another Japanese hostage Haruna Yukawa kneeling in orange jumpsuits between a masked man who threatened to kill them within 72 hours unless Japan paid a $200 million ransom.That demand has since shifted to one for the release of al-Rishawi. The militants reportedly have killed Yukawa 42 although that has not been confirmed.""This heinous terrorist act is totally unforgivable "" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said in parliament Thursday.Goto was captured in October in Syria apparently while trying to rescue Yukawa who was taken hostage last summer.In Tokyo Goto's mother Junko Ishido has been desperately pleading for the government to save her son.""Kenji has only a little time left "" she said Wednesday.Releasing the would-be hotel bomber linked to Al Qaeda would breach Jordan's usual hardline approach to the extremists and set a precedent for negotiating with them.It would also be a coup for ISIS which has already overrun large parts of neighboring Syria and Iraq. Jordan is part of a U.S.-led military alliance that has carried out airstrikes against the extremist group in Syria and Iraq in recent months.ISIS has not publicly demanded prisoner releases before and Jordan's main ally the United States opposes negotiations with extremists.Jordanian King Abdullah II faces growing domestic pressure to bring the pilot home. The pilot's father said he met on Wednesday with Jordan's king who he said assured him that ""everything will be fine.""The pilot's capture has hardened popular opposition among Jordanians to the air strikes analysts said""Public opinion in Jordan is putting huge pressure on the government to negotiate with the Islamic State group "" said Marwan Shehadeh a scholar with ties to ultra-conservative Islamic groups in Jordan. ""If the government doesn't make a serious effort to release him the morale of the entire military will deteriorate and the public will lose trust in the political regime.""The 26-year-old pilot al-Kaseasbeh was seized after his Jordanian F-16 crashed in December near the ISIS de facto capital of Raqqa in Syria. He is the first foreign military pilot the militants have captured since the coalition began its airstrikes in August.Previous captives may have been freed in exchange for ransom although the governments involved have refused to confirm any payments were made.ISIS broke with Al Qaeda's central leadership in 2013 and has clashed with its Syrian branch but it reveres the global terror network's former Iraqi affiliate which battled U.S. forces and claimed the 2005 Amman attack.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",http://us.cnn.com/2015/02/02/middleeast/isis-hostage/index.html,Jordan waits  Japan mourns after ISIS apparently beheads journalist,"Story highlightsJordan says it is still trying to free a pilot held captive by ISISRepeated demands for ISIS to prove the pilot is still alive have not yielded any results(CNN)As Japan mourns following the apparent beheading of its journalist by ISIS thousands of miles away an anxious Jordan awaits the fate of its pilot.Japanese journalist Kenji Goto went to Syria to tell the stories of lives torn apart by war.He apparently became the latest foreigner killed by ISIS after a video distributed Saturday appears to show his beheaded body.A week earlier another video had shown Goto holding a photo of what appeared to be the corpse of his fellow Japanese captive Haruna Yukawa apparently beheaded by ISIS militants as well.Japan and JordanJordan and Japan got caught in the militants' bloody crosshairs last month when ISIS threatened to kill the two Japanese hostages unless Japan's government paid a ransom of $200 million.Japan balked.The militants revised their offer: Jordan should release female suicide bomber Sajida al-Rishawi.Jordan countered with an offer demanding the release of Muath al-Kassasbeh a Jordanian military pilot captured in Syria in exchange for the suicide bomber. The militants have not said if that's a consideration. ISIS said it would kill him if Jordan didn't release al-Rishawi a convicted terrorist.Despite the counteroffers the pilot's fate remains unclear and Jordan says repeated demands for the militants to prove the pilot is still alive have not yielded any results.ISIS militants seized al-Kassasbeh was after his jet crashed in Syria in December. The 27-year-old holds the rank of lieutenant.Militants say they captured him after he ejected from his crashing F-16 during U.S.-led coalition airstrikes near ISIS' de facto capital Raqqa.Jordan's role in the coalition is not popular in the nation adding to the pressure for authorities to secure his release.'We will never never forgive them'World leaders condemned ISIS over the weekend as news of the latest apparent beheading spread.""We are deeply saddened by this despicable and horrendous act of terrorism and we denounce it in the strongest terms "" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said.

That's the same amount of money Abe recently pledged for those ""contending"" with ISIS.Days later a new message surfaced featuring what appeared to be the corpse of Yukawa.

""After putting considerable thought into making another run for president I've decided it's best to give other leaders in the party the opportunity to become our next nominee "" Romney told donors on a conference call Friday morning. The announcement comes after the 2012 GOP nominee who repeatedly denied interest in another campaign surprised donors earlier this month by telling them he was considering it. Since then the former Massachusetts governor spent three weeks calling donors and strategists and giving a handful of addresses including to a Republican National Committee summit. But while some from his former campaign team were willing to wait for his decision others were already gravitating toward the budding campaign of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. The two heavyweights were seen as competing for many of the same donors supporters and strategists. And some doubted whether Romney who lost to President Obama in 2012 after a campaign in which Democrats cast him as out-of-touch would be able to connect on a third run -- even as early polls showed him leading the GOP field. Romney in a written statement which he also read from on his conference call said he believes that he could win the nomination and that he would have enough funding and support. ""The reaction of Republican voters across the country was both surprising and heartening "" he said in the statement. At the same time Romney said it would have been a ""difficult test and a hard fight "" and it's time for a new voice. ""I believe that one of our next generation of Republican leaders one who may not be as well known as I am today one who has not yet taken their message across the country one who is just getting started may well emerge as being better able to defeat the Democrat nominee "" Romney said. ""In fact I expect and hope that to be the case."" He said he will not hire a campaign team will not take donations and will not organize a political action committee. Romney recently spoke with Bush in a private meeting in Utah. It's unclear whether that meeting set the stage for Friday's announcement. Bush in a written statement on Friday praised Romney as a party leader and a patriot. ""There are few people who have worked harder to elect Republicans across the country than he has "" he said. ""Though I'm sure today's decision was not easy I know that Mitt Romney will never stop advocating for renewing America's promise through upward mobility encouraging free enterprise and strengthening our national defense.""A day earlier it emerged that a key former Romney adviser was joining up with Bush's team. Bush recruited Romney's former senior Iowa adviser David Kochel as a senior strategist for his newly launched Right to Rise PAC. If Bush formally pursues a White House bid Kochel could take on a bigger role. Former Romney donors also told The Associated Press they were moving toward Bush. The donors in interviews with The Associated Press said they see in Bush what they liked about Romney in 2012 the capacity to serve successfully as president but also something Romney could not muster over two campaigns: the personality and senior staff needed to win the White House. Bush was hardly the only impediment to a Romney run. A slew of other high-profile Republicans are considering a campaign including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie Florida Sen. Marco Rubio Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Larry Sabato director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics said Romney just wasn't the ""giant"" of the field that he was in 2012. ""You've got a herd of people running for the Republican nomination for president "" he told Fox News. For a brief spell though Romney was back in his role as chief target of national Democrats some of whom relished the potential chance to hammer him in 2016. Speaking to Democrats in Philadelphia on Thursday President Obama said ""We've got a former presidential candidate on the other side who suddenly is just deeply concerned about poverty. That's great. Let's go. Come on."" He added: ""Let's do something about it. I am glad that their rhetoric at least has shifted. But let's now make sure that the policies match up with the rhetoric."" Romney responded on Twitter. ""Mr. Obama wonder why my concern about poverty? The record number of poor in your term and your record of failure to remedy "" he wrote.

On style it was Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz who saw strong receptions from the audience though support for a wide number of candidates was expressed in the hallways after the event.New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also sought to establish a deeper bond with Iowa. The Hawkeye State receives outsized attention in presidential years thanks to its first-in-the-nation status during the primary season.Marathon timeFor the 10-hour day of back-to-back speeches ""the candidates"" -- as they were called -- joined other high-profile Republicans at Hoyt Sherman Place an old intricate theater built in 1877 that also became the first public art museum in Des Moines.Billed as the Iowa Freedom Summit the event was co-hosted by Citizens United and Rep. Steve King a revered lawmaker who represents the northwestern part of the state and has considerable clout among the more social conservative and Christian right faction of the party.It was no secret that it was considered a cattle call for the presidential race. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee for example said that the reason he ended his Fox News show was for a bigger goal he has in mind.""It wasn't just so I can go deer hunting every weekend I can assure you that "" he said.Others were more blatant.""I am a potential presidential candidate yes I am "" former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina told CNN.Even Palin angled to get in on some of the action teasing ahead of her appearance Saturday that she was now seriously considering a run. And real estate titan Donald Trump told reporters Saturday that he'll make his decision before June.""I'm the one person who can make this country great again that's all I know "" he told reporters Saturday. ""Nobody else can.""Palin in her remarks was less forward. Ticking through a somewhat dizzying and hard-to-follow speech Palin suggested that the country is ready for a woman leader -- just not Hillary Clinton.""Hey Iowa can anyone stop Hillary?"" she said prompting the audience to cheer. ""To borrow a phrase yes we can!""The class of 2016The speakers who were typically allotted 20 minutes used a bulk of their speeches to share their own personal upbringings. Ben Carson and Christie talked about their strict but sharp mothers while Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz talked about having pastors as fathers.Other more well-known names in Iowa like former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum who won the state's caucuses in 2012 and Huckabee who won in 2008 tried to remind Iowans why they picked them in the first place dipping into their personalities but also focusing on the issues.Given King's firebrand credentials as an outspoken opponent of illegal immigration it was no surprise that problems at the border became a focal point in much of the speeches Saturday.Carson a retired neurosurgeon argued ""there wouldn't be people coming in here if there wasn't a magnet pulling them in "" suggesting there should be criminal punishment for employers who hire undocumented workers.The main target in the immigration battle however was President Barack Obama's executive action to delay deportation for up to five million undocumented immigrants. Or as Palin put it in her folksy swagger Obama's decision makes him seem ""like an overgrown little boy who's just acting kinda spoiled.""Speakers railed against the President's pledge to use his ""pen and his phone"" to work around Congress with immigration as just one example of what many called the president's ""overreach.""That was punctuated when DREAM Act Coalition protesters interrupted Rick Perry's speech leading to one arrest and theater full of Iowans trying to drown out the demonstrators' chants.The potential candidates also warned about what they see as a dire path for the country in particular when it comes to foreign policy a theme that along with immigration also seems poised to become a flash point in the 2016 presidential race unlike in 2012.Santorum argued that the growth of ISIS is a consequence of the ""isolationism"" and ""weakness"" from the Obama's administration. Cruz like several speakers said the President will fail in the war on terror if he refuses to use the words ""radical Islamic terrorism.""Huckabee blasted Obama for devoting more time to climate change in the State of the Union address than talking about terrorism.""A beheading is a far greater threat to Americans than a sunburn "" Huckabee said.The issuesThere was plenty of the usual Iowa charm on stage speeches with pig analogies and corn references. And there was more than one reference to how people in Iowa are somehow taller than average.Shown on a big screen above the stage was an image of a red barn sitting on a green hill surrounded by white fences. Steve King's name in all caps was plastered across banners on the stage as well as the podium.The contenders also dished out a bevy of red meat blasting Obamacare Common Core the media Hillary Clinton and the $18 trillion debt. Cruz won huge applause for proposing to place 110 000 IRS employees on the southern border joking that they'll do a better job at deterring illegal immigration than anything else.Giving a shout out to the state's newly elected U.S. senator Joni Ernst was also a popular item on the agenda for the potential candidates. Nearly all of them referred to her as their ""friend "" and almost equal amount of affection and time was dedicated to the state's other beloved senator Chuck Grassley.Walker who like Cruz paced the stage back and forth as he spoke delivered an impressive speech that honed in on his record as governor. He talked about implementing voter ID laws and he painted himself as the valiant warrior who took on the public employees and won during the collective bargaining rights debate of 2011.He also didn't forget to mention that he's been elected three times in the past four years.Shortly after his speech two men both from Council Bluffs talked outside about how they were wowed by Walker's remarks.""If he could do on a nationwide scale what he did in Wisconsin this country would be "" one man Michael Patomson started to say before his friend Bill Hartzell interjected: ""Transformed. The country would be transformed.""The receptionMany attendees had a hard time picking just one favorite in the line of potential contenders. Several mentioned Fiorina as a surprise hit.""There was just a pantheon of people to listen to "" said Eric Rosenthal of Cedar Rapids.""Rick Perry was better than last time I heard him that's good. He needs it "" said Ernie Rudolph of Dallas County Iowa.Christie also saw a warm reception and contested the idea that a Republican governor of a blue state who has a ""Jersey guy"" reputation will not connect with voters in Iowa.""That somehow I'm too loud I'm too blunt and I'm too direct "" Christie said dismissing the criticism as ""conventional wisdom"" from Washington pundits. ""They're wrong.""Still he was noticeably different from his usual style. His demeanor was toned down and he read from his prepared remarks on the podium a stark contrast to his preferred off-the-cuff method.Some of the chatter in the hallways and to reporters also featured two potential contenders who weren't there: Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney.Trump put it simply: ""Mitt had his chance. He should have won and he choked."" As for Bush: ""We've had enough of the Bushes.""Sens. Rand Paul and Marco Rubio as well as Gov. Bobby Jindal also skipped the event but given that it's year ahead before Iowans start to caucus it's unlikely that missing one event will hurt them.Saturday's event was more of a curtain raiser giving the first glimpse of what will likely be a competitive Republican primary.Walker as he closed his speech offered a pledge that will likely be mirrored by several of the speakers on stage over the next year: ""I'm going to come back many more times.""",23,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/01/31/no-word-on-fate-jordanian-pilot-after-isis-threatened-to-kill-him/,No word on fate of Jordanian pilot after ISIS threatened to kill him,"Jordan willing to swap ISIS hostage for captured pilotAMMAN Jordan  The family of a Jordanian fighter pilot held by the Islamic State group said Saturday it has received no word on his fate since the militants threatened to kill him earlier this week.The Islamic State group purportedly threatened to kill Lt. Muath al-Kaseasbeh by Thursday unless Jordan released a female al-Qaida prisoner Sajida al-Rishawi from death row. Jordan has said it cannot release her without proof the pilot is alive.The fate of the 26-year-old airman has been linked to that of Japanese journalist Kenji Goto who also is being held by the militants.Japan's deputy foreign minister Yasuhide Nakayama said late Friday that efforts to free Goto are ""in a state of deadlock.""""The deadline has passed and it is a reality that several hours have passed since then so we are doing our utmost to gain more information "" he said.In their purported ultimatum the militants did not say what would happen to Goto if al-Rishawi is not released.The family of the pilot also said there has been no word.""We are waiting "" Jawad al-Kaseasbeh a brother of the pilot said Saturday. ""We received nothing new neither from the government nor from informal sources.""Al-Kaseasbeh's plane went down over an Islamic State-controlled area of northeastern Syria in December. He is the first foreign pilot to be captured by the group since a U.S.-led military coalition began carrying out airstrikes against the extremists in September. Jordan is part of the coalition.Goto was captured in October after he traveled to Syria to try to win the release of Haruna Yukawa.The hostage drama began last week after militants threatened to kill Goto and Yukawa in 72 hours unless Japan paid $200 million.The militants later demanded the release of al-Rishawi 44 who faces death by hanging for her role in a 2005 al-Qaida attack on hotels in Amman that killed 60 people.

He said ISIS forces had raided 360 villages around Kobani from which the people ""ran away like rats.""But the reason behind their withdrawal from the city he said ""is that we no longer had places to hold there. We were inside Ayn Al-Islam and we occupied more than 70% but the airstrikes did not leave any building standing they destroyed everything.""His horror of the airstrikes was apparent.""I swear by God their planes did not leave the air day and night; they did airstrikes all day and night. They targeted everything. They even attacked motorcycles; they have not left a building standing. But by God willing we will return and we will have our revenge multiplied.""ISIS assault on KirkukISIS is on its heels after the loss of Kobani and an offensive by Kurdish Peshmerga -- armed fighters who protect Iraq's Kurdish region -- around Mosul Iraq's second-largest city and a focal point for all sides in the conflict.But on Friday the Sunni extremist group launched an assault on Iraq's oil-rich city of Kirkuk in what may be an attempt to divert Kurdish troops from Mosul.A report by Rudaw a private website dedicated to presenting news from a Kurdish perspective said at least 30 ISIS fighters were killed in the assault and 15 captured.Casualties on the other side included Brig. Gen. Shirko Fateh the highest-ranking operational commander of the Peshmerga brigade located in Kirkuk.ISIS captured 15 employees working at the Khabbaz oilfield southwest of Kirkuk after launching their assault in the area Brig. Gen. Sarhat Qader the head of Kirkuk's suburbs and villages police told CNN on Saturday.A joint operation is underway by his police officers Peshmerga and Kurdish security forces to free the hostages and take back control of the oilfield seized by ISIS militants on Friday Qader said.Troops have already liberated Al-Assal village also taken by ISIS on Friday and located next to Khabbaz oil field he said.Meanwhile Gen. Hussein Mansour the head of Peshmerga forces in Jalawla in Diyala province was killed in clashes with ISIS in southwestern Kirkuk Saman Jabari a senior Kurdish figure and local Peshmerga leader told CNN on Saturday.Mansour brought his troops from Jalawla about 100 miles away to reinforce the Peshmerga in Kirkuk following the ISIS assault he said.Coalition Peshmerga try to prevent new front openingU.S. and coalition aircraft carried out 17 airstrikes in Iraq on Friday according to a U.S. Central Command statement 10 of them near Kirkuk and two near Mosul.Both the coalition and the Peshmerga are trying to prevent ISIS from opening a new front in Kirkuk which ISIS likely hoped would lessen the pressure on Mosul. Additionally by going on the offensive here ISIS appears to be offering some obvious targets for strikes.If ISIS can be driven back from positions in Kirkuk it will have to try other tactical offensives to draw Kurdish forces away from the outskirts of Mosul.The Kurds on their own admission have no intention of entering Mosul but want to choke off ISIS supply lines into the city.Another 10 airstrikes were carried out Friday against ISIS targets in Syria eight of them near Kobani.Deaths in KobaniAccording to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights a London-based opposition group from October 6 to Monday the fighting for Kobani killed 979 ISIS combatants 324 YPG fighters and 12 rebels backing the YPG.Thirty-eight more ISIS militants died in attacks using booby-trapped vehicles or bomb belts and the ISIS shelling of Kobani killed 12 civilians SOHR said.""On the other hand hundreds of (ISIS) militants died during U.S. and Arab allies' airstrikes on the city and its countryside "" the group said.However the success of the coalition airstrikes in Kobani will be hard to replicate elsewhere.There are almost no civilians left in the city of Kobani and most residents left early on when the fighting started especially in the contested areas close to the front line.This meant airstrikes were fairly straightforward with the coalition able to target one side and avoid civilian casualties. The front line was well defined so it was clear where the ISIS and Kurdish fighters were.A more challenging situation is when airstrikes seek to target ISIS inside populated areas like Mosul in Iraq Raqqa in Syria and other cities under ISIS control.Here the effectiveness of airstrikes is limited because of the risk of casualties among civilians. When coalition airstrikes hit cities in Aleppo in northern Syria civilian deaths were reported last year.",24,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/02/03/fbi-offering-25k-reward-for-info-on-suspect-in-abduction-slaying-elderly-ohio/,FBI offering $25K reward for info on suspect in abduction  slaying of elderly Ohio couple,CLEVELAND  The FBI has joined a manhunt for a suspect in the abduction and killings of an elderly Ohio couple who is also believed to have committed armed robberies in three states over the weekend.A spokeswoman says the FBI is offering a $25 000 reward for information about 29-year-old Robert Clark.

Merkel says that's a bad idea.""The progress that Ukraine needs cannot be achieved with more weapons "" she said.

It called for a drawback of heavy weapons self-rule in the eastern regions and a buffer zone to be set up along the Russia-Ukraine border.But the agreement quickly disintegrated and the violence continued.The new plan envisions a much broader demilitarized zone to run along the current front lines.All the while the crisis in Ukraine which stemmed from a trade agreement has killed more than 5 000 people including many civilians.At least 224 civilians were killed in the final three weeks of January alone the U.N. high commissioner for human rights said.Explosion rattles facility in DonetskOn Sunday a strong explosion rocked what the website for the city of Donetsk referred to as a chemical goods plant.However Dmytro Yarosh a Ukrainian lawmaker and Right Sector battalion commander wrote on Facebook that Ukrainian artillery hit a warehouse containing BM-21 GRAD rocket launchers.

A police detective has described how officers found a shell casing and blue bubble gum that they used to link former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez to a June 2013 killing.North Attleborough police Detective Michael Elliott is being cross-examined by Hernandez lawyer James Sultan on Wednesday.Hernandez is charged with killing Odin Lloyd who was dating his fiancee's sister.Elliott said they were called by a rental car company worker who told them several items had been removed from a car Hernandez rented and put in a trash bin.Elliott said police searched the bin and found the shell casing attached to the gum.Sultan questioned the way police handled the items.Prosecutors have said Hernandez bought blue bubble gum shortly before the killing.,http://us.cnn.com/2015/02/20/us/hernandez-evidence-shoes/index.html,The case against Aaron Hernandez: Where are the shoes?,"Story highlightsShoes prosecutors say Hernandez wore on night of Lloyd's death are missingHernandez is on trial for murder of Lloyd and has pleaded not guiltyLinking shoes to impressions at crime scene would help prosecution with its case(CNN)A murder weapon isn't the only thing missing as prosecutors try to convince jurors that former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez orchestrated the execution of Odin Lloyd.The shoes prosecutors say Hernandez was wearing at the industrial park where Lloyd was killed also have seemingly vanished into thin air.""The shoes and footprints caused by the shoes (are) a big deal "" says CNN legal analyst Paul Callan a former homicide prosecutor.A big deal because connecting an athletic shoe impression found near Lloyd's body to Hernandez could help prove he directly participated in Lloyd's death.Jury sees video of Hernandez taking apart cell phone 03:03PLAY VIDEOLloyd 27 was shot once in the back and six times in the front in June 2013 -- the final two bullets fired as he lay face up according to the medical examiner. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty.Aaron Hernandez's downward spiralThe sneakers prosecutors believe Hernandez wore the night of Lloyd's death were within the grasp of investigators who visited the ex-football star's home but it appears no one knew it at the time.Investigators photographed a pair of Nike Air Jordan XI Retro Low brand sneakers during one of their first searches of Hernandez's home according to court papers but did not take them in as evidence.When Lloyd's body was discovered crime scene investigators singled out one of two footwear impressions early on because one didn't match the ""lugged sole"" shoes of police nor the shoes of first responders or civilian witnesses who found Lloyd's body according to court documents.When police began executing search warrants for weapons and clothing at Hernandez's home on June 18 and June 22 2013 they also were looking for shoes that could match that print in the dirt according to court files and testimony.So far jurors have not been told that somehow three other sets of sneakers neatly lined up side by side along a bedroom wall in the basement were overlooked.Hernandez's basement ""man cave"" includes a pool table with a Patriots logo.The basement also has a screening room and a bar.So far jurors have not been told that somehow three other sets of sneakers neatly lined up side by side along a bedroom wall in the basement were overlooked and ""appeared to be in good condition "" according to an affidavit. The basement is where Hernandez's man cave is located and is complete with bar a screening room a pool table with a New England Patriot's logo and a trophy room.That affidavit dated November 14 2014 says that after studying images and home security video and having ""consulted with Nike "" investigators believe those three pairs of shoes are ""believed to be produced by Nike and Creative Recreation."" They are the white and black Air Jordan XI Retros the red Creative Recreation Cesario low tops; and the brown Nike Air Jordan winterized spike sneakers allegedly worn by Hernandez Wallace and Ortiz respectively.Wallace and Ortiz are also charged with the murder of Lloyd. They have pleaded not guilty and are going to be tried separately.Wallace and Ortiz are seen on home security video entering the house and going into the basement after getting out of a car minutes after Lloyd was fatally shot in a nearby industrial park. Prosecutors say the cable connecting the basement security camera labeled ""man cave "" was unplugged after the three men went downstairs.Chilling crime scene video in Hernandez case 02:44PLAY VIDEOAuthorities say the ""outsole pattern "" of the Air Jordan XI Retro Low's allegedly worn by Hernandez is ""similar to and consistent with the unidentified shoe impression... in close proximity to the body of Odin Lloyd "" according to the affidavit. It also states the XI Retro Lows became available for public sale only three weeks before Lloyd's murder.Yet it wasn't until almost a year and a half later when investigators were making final trial preparations last November that they ""noted"" the three pairs of shoes in photographs and realized they could still be at Hernandez's home a search warrant affidavit states.In court papers investigators said the sneakers appear to match shoe prints found at the scene where Lloyd was fatally shot.In order to look again police asked a court to approve another search warrant. The application also points out home surveillance video showing Wallace and Ortiz leaving the home after the shooting -- wearing sandals.Trying to make the case for another search investigators also quote a jailhouse phone call dated December 25 2013 between Hernandez and his fiancee Shayanna Jenkins.Aaron Hernandez fiance granted immunity for testimony 02:12PLAY VIDEOHernandez told Jenkins ""You still got my my clothes at the house and s?""Jenkins responded ""I really don't understand. I mean where do you think your clothes are?...Your clothes are exactly where they're supposed to be.....I mean you've only been gone for what six months?""""Yeah "" Hernandez said.""You act like you're gonna be gone for like 20 years "" Jenkins replied.But when police searched the home again on November 24 they didn't find the shoes.Details about the missing Nike sneakers have not yet come up at trial. How might it play with the jury?""Jurors will wonder why didn't investigators seize the shoes at the same time they seized many other pieces of evidence from Hernandez's home "" says University of New Hampshire law professor Michael McMann who's closely monitoring the trial.""If jurors determine investigators and prosecutors simply made a mistake in not seizing the shoes it could damage the jurors' confidence in the case. It's possible prosecutors could try to mollify this concern by noting that rules of evidence and pretrial discovery limit the types of evidence they can be taken from a person's home.""",30,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/03/11/university-oklahoma-students-in-racist-chant-controversy-face-expulsion/,Expelled University of Oklahoma student apologizes for racist chant,"Oklahoma fraternity shut down over racist chantNever autoplay videosOne of the two University of Oklahoma students identified as singing a racist chant caught on video apologized Tuesday calling it a ""horrible mistake.""Parker Rice and Levi Pettit were expelled from the university Tuesday after the video's release.In a statement to the Dallas Morning News Rice said he was ""deeply sorry"" for his involvement in the chant caught on film Saturday night and then posted online.

The virus may have contributed to the 2014 death of a Kansas man who was otherwise healthy.Working with experts from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) and University of Kansas Medical Center (UKMC) researchers found that the virus is part of a group of viruses called thogotoviruses. The virus was named Bourbon virus for the county in which the patient lived. The case is the first time a thogotovirus has been shown to cause human illness in the U.S. and the eighth known case of it causing symptoms in people.According to the report the patient who was over 50 years old was working outside on his property in late spring 2014 when he received several tick bites andfound an engorged tick on his shoulder. Several days later he fell ill with nausea weakness and diarrhea. The next day he developed a fever anorexia chills headache myalgia and arthralgia. The patient visited his primary care physician on the third day at which point he was prescribed an antibiotic for a presumed tickborne illness. The next morning his wife found him experiencing reduced consciousness and we was taken to the local hospital.Test results for many infectious diseases came back negative and a sample of the patients blood was sent to the CDC which found evidence of an unidentified virus. Researchers used Advanced Molecular Detection (AMD) and determined it was a new virus.According to the news release the CDC is working with KDHE and UKMC to identify additional cases of Bourbon virus disease determine who gets sick and with what symptoms and how people are getting infected. CDC experts are also working to better understand the virus itself to potentially prevent and control Bourbon virus.CDC researchers believe other undiscovered viruses are likely causing illness with this finding and recent discoveries of Heartland virus in Missouri and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome viruses in China.,http://us.cnn.com/2015/02/20/health/new-virus-discovered/index.html,Man's death leads to discovery of new virus in Kansas  CDC reports,"Story highlightsThe CDC named the Bourbon virus after the Kansas county where the patient livedThe 50-year-old man died 11 days after falling ill the CDC saysThe virus is probably spread by tick and insect bites the CDC says(CNN)The CDC has discovered a new virus that may have contributed to a Kansas man's death the agency announced Friday.Named the Bourbon virus after the county where the patient lived the virus is likely spread by tick or insect bites the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.A 50-year-old man suffered multiple tick bites in the spring of 2014 while working outside on his property the CDC said in an article published in the agency's ""Infectious Diseases"" journal.The man fell ill over the next two days went to a doctor on the third day was hospitalized and died of a heart attack 11 days after becoming sick the CDC said.While the man was hospitalized test results for many infectious diseases came back negative the press release said.

The man had low blood counts for cells that fight infection and help prevent bleeding the website said.Though the CDC only has one case to work with the agency said ""it is likely that Bourbon virus is spread through tick or other insect bites.""The CDC recommends people protect themselves by tick bites by using insect repellents wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants avoiding bushy and wooded areas and checking for ticks after spending time outdoors.The Bourbon virus is part of a group of viruses linked to tick or insect bites in Europe Asia and Africa the CDC said.This is the first time a virus in this group known as thogotoviruses has been known to cause illness in the United States the CDC said.Is your smartphone bad for you?Two big flu myths debunkedKnow when and where the flu will hitHow to tell if your child is sickIs that plastic on your teeth?",33,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/03/08/black-teen-killed-by-wisconsin-police-officer-prompts-protests/,Protests follow fatal police shooting of unarmed 19-year-old in Wisconsin,"March 7 2015: People gather during a rally protesting the shooting death of Tony Robinson. (AP)MADISON Wis.  Peaceful protesters in Madison took to the college town's streets with chants of ""Black Lives Matter"" following the fatal shooting of an unarmed black 19-year-old by a white police officer who authorities say fired after he was assaulted. The city's police chief said he understood the anger assuring demonstrators his department would defend their rights as he implored the community to act with restraint.Tony Robinson died Friday night after being shot in his apartment following a confrontation with Officer Matt Kenny who had forced his way inside after hearing a disturbance while responding to a call authorities and neighbors said.Madison Police Chief Mike Koval on Saturday said Kenny was injured but didn't provide details. It wasn't clear whether Robinson who died at a hospital was alone.""He was unarmed. That's going to make this all the more complicated for the investigators for the public to accept "" Koval said of Robinson. The department said Kenny would not have been wearing a body camera.Several dozen protesters who gathered outside the police department Saturday afternoon held signs and chanted ""Black Lives Matter"" -- a slogan adopted by activists and protesters nationwide after recent officer-involved deaths of unarmed blacks -- before walking toward the neighborhood where the shooting took place.The shooting came days after the U.S. Justice Department said it would not issue civil rights charges against Darren Wilson the white former Ferguson Missouri officer who fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown who was black and unarmed after a struggle in the street last August.Federal officials did however find patterns of racial profiling bigotry and profit-driven law enforcement in the St. Louis suburb which saw spates of sometimes-violent protests in the wake of the shooting and a grand jury's decision not to charge Wilson.Other high-profile deaths of black suspects at the hands of police officers have prompted nationwide protests including that of Eric Garner who died in July after New York City officers put him in a chokehold and a video showed him repeatedly saying ""I can't breathe."" A Cleveland police officer in November fatally shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice who had been pointing a pellet gun at a playground. A Milwaukee police officer who fatally shot Dontre Hamilton last April was found to have acted in self-defense but was fired for ignoring department policy regarding mental illness.Koval struck a conciliatory tone Saturday while addressing the potential for more protests in Madison saying he understood the community's distrust after ""this tragic death.""""For those who do want to take to the street and protest "" Koval said his department would be there to ""defend facilitate foster those First Amendment rights of assembly and freedom of speech."" The promise echoed as a stark contrast to Ferguson where an aggressive police response to protesters after Brown's death drew worldwide attention.Koval also asked protesters to follow what he said was the lead of Robinson's family in asking for ""nondestructive"" demonstrations.The chief said he had gone to Robinson's mother's house overnight and spoken with his grandparents and expressed sympathy to his family Saturday saying ""19 years old is too young.""Family members at community meeting later read a statement prepared by Robinson's mother Andrea Irwin.""I can't even compute what has happened "" Irwin's statement said. ""I haven't even had a chance to see his body.""Koval said Kenny a more than 12-year veteran of the Madison department also shot and killed a suspect in 2007 but was cleared of wrongdoing because it was a ""suicide by cop-type"" situation. In that shooting Kenny responded to a 911 call of a man with a gun and shot the man twice after police said he pointed the gun at officers. It turned out to be a pellet gun.A picture of Kenny on the Madison department's website shows him with a police horse he trains alongside a short first-person bio in which he says he served nine years in the U.S. Coast Guard before joining the department.Kenny has been placed on administrative leave pending results of an investigation by the state's Division of Criminal Investigation.A 2014 Wisconsin law requires police departments to have outside agencies investigate officer-involved deaths after three high-profile incidents within a decade -- including one in Madison -- didn't result in criminal charges raising questions from the victims' families about the integrity of investigations.Madison about 80 miles west of Milwaukee is the state capital and home to the University of Wisconsin's flagship campus. About 7 percent of the city's 243 000 residents are black. Neighbors said Robinson's apartment is in a two-story gray house on Williamson Street known to many as Willy Street.Chief Koval said police responded to a call about 6:30 p.m. Friday of a person jumping into traffic.

Sky News reported that control of the region is split between ISIS and opposing Kurdish fighters.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights which relies on a network of activists inside Syria reported that 90 people have been abducted.Nuri Kino the head of the activist group A Demand For Action -- which focuses on religious minorities in the Middle East -- said the militants took between 70 and 100 Assyrians captive. Kino said his organization based its information on conversations with villagers who fled the onslaught as well as their relatives.Kino added that some 3 000 people managed to flee the onslaught and have sought refuge in the cities of Hassakeh and the provincial capital of Qamishli.Both activist groups said that most of the captives come from the village of Tal Shamiram located some 50 miles southwest of Qamishli.An Assyrian woman from Tal Shamiram who now lives in Beirut said she has been scrambling to find out what has become of her parents as well as her brother and his wife and kids.""Land lines have been cut their mobiles are closed "" she told The Associated Press. ""Have they been slaughtered? Are they still alive?

ISIS frequently refers to Christians as ""crusaders."" Syria's official SANA news agency reported that ISIS overran seven villages during an attack on Monday.It was not immediately clear what ISIS planned to do with the Assyrians.The militants have a long history of killing captives including foreign journalists Syrian soldiers and Kurdish militiamen. Most recently militants in Libya affiliated with ISIS released a video showing the beheading of 21 Egyptian Christians.But ISIS also could use its Assyrian captives to try to arrange a prisoner swap with the Kurdish and Christian militias that it faced off against in northeastern Syria. There is a precedent: The extremists have released Kurdish schoolchildren as well as Turkish truck drivers and diplomats after holding them for months.Last year ISIS abducted several Assyrians in retaliation for some of them fighting alongside the Kurdish People's Protection Units or YPG. But most were released after long negotiations Reuters reports.Sky News reported that the abductions followed heavy fighting in the area which is near the borders with Turkey and Iraq. The area also has been the target of several recent airstrikes by the U.S.-led coalition.Kurdish fighters from the YPG launched an offensive over the weekend quickly seizing some 20 villages from the extremists.The fighting continued through Tuesday as the YPG has captured another 10 villages the Observatory said.The Associated Press contributed to this report.Click for more from Sky News.

She said the kidnappers were interrogating the hostages about whether the women were members of local militias.'They are facing death'Edward said he feared the hostages would face the same fate as Assyrians targeted in Iraq and the more than 20 members of Egypt's Coptic Christian minority slaughtered by ISIS in Libya last month.""Maybe they are facing the same destiny. That's why we call on all over the world like the U.S Europe coalition forces -- protect Assyrians save Assyrians in Syria "" he said.""They are facing death people are unarmed they are peaceful. And they need help they are just left alone -- no one's protecting them.""Edward said some 35 Assyrian villages and towns had now been taken over by ISIS forcing thousands of families to flee.Some 600 families have taken refuge in St. Mary's Cathedral in al-Hasakah Syria he said Tuesday.The Assyrians lack food water blankets and other necessities after years caught in the middle of a civil war.ISIS has attacked numerous minority groups during a bloody campaign to create a vast caliphate across Syria and Iraq under its extreme version of Sharia law.'We gave the country our name'Some Assyrians have taken up arms in an attempt to defend their communities fighting alongside the Kurdish Peshmerga militia which has made some recent gains against ISIS in Syria's northeast.As a result ISIS' decision to target the Assyrian community in al-Hasakah province may have an element of military as well as religious motivation.The Assyrians have a history dating back some 4 000 years to the time of Mesopotamia considered one of the cradles of civilization and the birthplace of writing and literature. While their first religion was Ashurism Assyrians have been predominantly Christian since the third century.""How can Syria be Syria without the Assyrians?

He's married and his wife is eight months pregnant.In 2013 a complaint was filed alleging that Slager used excessive force against another unarmed black man. The man Mario Givens says Slager showed up at his door and used a stun gun on him in the stomach. Givens was later released without charge.Slager was allowed to stay on the force. The police department says it will now review that case again.Slager was denied bond. If convicted he could face 30 years to life in prison.

Iraqi state TV trumpeted the start of the offensive Monday morning reporting that ground forces were advancing amid artillery fire and Iraqi jet strikes. The source said that these forces were being ""supported by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps on the ground"" while the U.S. French and Iraqi air forces were all conducting sorties to aid the ground troops.Militants were reportedly sent running from some areas outside the city. Tikrit some 80 miles north of Baghdad fell into the hands of ISIS last summer along with the country's second-largest city of Mosul and other areas in its Sunni heartland. The city which has an estimated population of around 260 000 people may be best known as the hometown of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. Any operation to take Mosul likely would require Iraq to seize Tikrit first as the town sits on the main road from Baghdad. U.S. military officials have said a coordinated military mission to retake Mosul will likely begin in April or May and involve up to 25 000 Iraqi troops. But they have cautioned that if the Iraqis aren't ready the timing could be delayed. Past attempts to retake Tikrit have failed and Iraqi authorities say they have not set a date to launch a major operation to recapture Mosul.News of the offensive came hours after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi called on Sunni tribal fighters to abandon ISIS warning that Tikrit ""will soon return to its people.""Al-Abadi offered the Sunnis what he called ""the last chance"" and promised them a pardon during a news conference in Samarra 60 miles north of Baghdad. His office said he arrived in Samarra to ""supervise the operation to liberate Tikrit from the terrorist gangs.""""I call upon those who have been misled or committed a mistake to lay down arms and join their people and security forces in order to liberate their cities "" al-Abadi said.The Iraqi military previously launched an operation in late June to try to wrest back control of Tikrit but that quickly stalled. Other planned offensives by Iraq's military which collapsed under the initial ISIS blitz also have failed to make up ground though soldiers have taken back the nearby refinery town of Beiji backed by airstrikes from a U.S.-led coalition.Al-Abadi's comments appear to be targeting former members of Iraq's outlawed Baath party loyalists to Saddam Hussein who joined ISIS during its offensive as well as other Sunnis who were dissatisfied with Baghdad's Shiite-led government. The premier likely hopes to peel away some support from the terror group especially as Iraqis grow increasingly horrified by the extremists' mass killings and other atrocities.In February alone violence across Iraq killed at least 1 100 Iraqis including more than 600 civilians the U.N. Assistance Mission in Iraq said Sunday. Last year was the deadliest in Iraq since its 2006-2007 sectarian bloodshed with a total of 12 282 people killed and 23 126 wounded according to the U.N.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

The Sunni extremist group blew up a key bridge near Tikrit preventing the joint Iraqi forces from using it to cross the Tigris River to approach the city from the east.Nevertheless forces have made progress forcing ISIS fighters to retreat toward the city center from frontline positions Hashd Al-Shaabi's media office said.There have been several failed attempts to recapture Tikrit since the second half of 2014. If Iraq regains control of the city it could mean that retaking Mosul -- a city 10 times bigger -- is possible.The Tikrit offensive involves around 30 000 fighters.Ramadi under fierce assault by ISISWhile Iraqi forces piled the pressure on ISIS in Tikrit the Sunni extremist group continued to flex its muscles in Iraq's western Anbar province.ISIS launched a new offensive on the city of Ramadi west of Baghdad on Wednesday morning Faleh al-Issawi the deputy head of the Anbar Provincial Council said in a statement.The city is being attacked ""from all directions "" with ISIS firing more than 150 mortar rounds and rockets toward it he said.Some 17 explosives-laden vehicles have been detonated at various security checkpoints and in the city center he said.This is ""the fiercest attack by ISIS"" seen on Ramadi al-Issawi said. Iraqi forces have imposed a curfew on the city.Al-Issawi said air cover by the Iraqi air force was urgently needed. ""We need air cover to repel these attacks but did not see the Iraqi air force do anything -- we only saw one airstrike by the coalition hitting one target "" he said.Officials believe ""this is an ISIS response to the Tikrit operation that is ongoing in the north "" he added.He said there had been 10 casualties among Iraqi forces in the area but did not specify how many were killed and how many injured.Hide Caption54 of 54The ISIS terror threat 54 photosAn Iraqi Shiite fighter looks through binoculars on Sunday March 8 in Albu Ajil Iraq as smoke rises on the horizon.

The video shows four officers struggling with the man near a curb when the clicking of what sounds like a stun gun is heard and then about five shots ring out.Someone is heard yelling ""Drop the gun '' right before the shots are heard. Onlookers then accost the officers at the scene. The video was apparently posted online within hours of the death by a man named Anthony Blackburn.LAPD Cmdr.

One witness said the man had been fighting with someone else in his tent when police arrived. That witness said officers dragged the victim out of the tent before he began fighting. Other witnesses said the man punched and kicked the officers before reaching for their service weapons. ""He didn't have no weapon they just shot him "" a witness Yolanda Young told KTTV. ""They could have just wrestled him down and took him to jail but they shot him five times. """"When they couldn't apprehend him that's when they backed up and just started shooting. Pow pow pow pow.

Jurors in the murder trial of former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez are being shown records from his cellphone in the days surrounding the killing.Hernandez is accused of killing Odin Lloyd who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. Lloyd was shot to death early on June 17 2013. His body was found in an industrial park not far from Hernandez's home.A representative from Dallas-based AT&T has been going through Hernandez's cellphone records with prosecutors.AT&T's Christopher Ritchell testified Tuesday that according to their records Hernandez's cellphone did not communicate with the network for more than 20 hours in the time before and after Lloyd was killed.,http://us.cnn.com/2015/03/06/us/hernandez-trial-key-moments/index.html,Aaron Hernandez trial: What you missed,"Story highlightsTestimony this week focused on DNA fingerprints and tire treadsMother tells Susan Candiotti that court ""went very well"" for HernandezJurors also heard details about cell phone records and cell towers(CNN)Five full weeks into Aaron Hernandez's murder trial prosecutors have called 77 witnesses. Jurors have yet to hear from the former NFL star's fiance Shayanna Jenkins New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick or owner Robert Kraft.But this week did bring emotional testimony and important developments in the case against Hernandez who has pleaded not guilty to killing Odin Lloyd in 2013.Check out some of the key moments you might have missed this week.DNA said linked to Hernandez LloydA DNA analyst from the Massachusetts State Police crime lab said she found that Hernandez's DNA matched the DNA taken from a marijuana joint found near Lloyd's body at the crime scene. Lloyd's DNA also was found on the blunt.The DNA analyst Diane Biagiotti testified to finding a partial DNA match from Hernandez on the shell casing found in the dumpster of the Enterprise rental car office. But under cross-examination lead defense attorney Jamie Sultan got Biagiotti to acknowledge there's a high likelihood that DNA from chewing gum could have transferred to the shell casing found in the dumpster.The office manager at the rental car office Keelia Smyth testified that she put the shell casing and the gum together after finding the items in the Nissan Altima returned by Hernandez on June 17 2013. She said she threw them in the trash bin outside of her office.Inside Hernandez's downward spiralIt was revealed by Sultan that the state never submitted the gum for DNA testing. The state has not yet explained why. We may hear the answer during the state's redirect of Biagiotti on Monday. Hernandez is seen on surveillance video buying gum and he also offered some to Smyth.Biagiotti said under cross-examination that it's highly unlikely to find DNA on any shell casing. One reason is because the heat from the gun wipes away any DNA she said. The shell casings found at the crime scene did not have enough DNA on them to produce a DNA profile.Police: Hernandez 'agitated' and 'upset' after murder 02:29PLAY VIDEOHernandez's family was in court on Friday after a week's absence. Hernandez's mother Terri Hernandez told CNN' that she thought Friday ""went very well"" for him.Fingerprints tire treadsTestimony this week also focused on fingerprints from Hernandez and Lloyd that were found inside the rented Nissan Altima.The car also had fingerprints of Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz who are also charged with killing Lloyd. They have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately.State Trooper David Mackin a fingerprint expert with the Massachusetts State Police crime scene services reported finding the fingerprints of Wallace and Ortiz in a Chrysler 300 that Hernandez rented. Prosecutors call it the ""getaway car "" which was ultimately found abandoned in Bristol Connecticut.But no prints were found on the .22-caliber gun recovered on the edge of a wooded area near Hernandez's home. Hernandez is charged with illegal possession of that gun.In addition no prints were found on any of the shell casings including the casing found stuck to the blue bubblegum in the dumpster outside the Enterprise office.Another key find: tire treads of the rear passenger tire of the Altima matched a tire impression found at the crime scene according to court testimony.Lloyd's sister testifies about texts she received from himShaquilla Thibou Lloyd's younger sister and the last family member to see him before he was killed took the stand Monday.About an hour before his death she said she watched him get into a silver Nissan Altima as she sat in a friend's car outside her home.Thibou who was 19 at the time of her brother's killing told jurors that when Lloyd first walked to the car he opened the front passenger door. He stopped and then opened the back passenger door and entered the car.Chilling crime scene video in Hernandez case 02:44PLAY VIDEO""The light came on and there was a shadow in the back seat "" she said.Then she saw the Altima pull away. It was 2:32 a.m.Thirty minutes later Thibou returned to her home and charged her dead phone. She noticed a text from her big brother.Thibou was not allowed to share with jurors what was said in those texts. The judge ruled there is not enough proof the text message meant Lloyd feared for his life legally called ""a dying declaration.""That means that the jury did not hear that at 3:07 a.m. Lloyd texted his sister asking ""U saw who I'm with?""At 3:11 a.m he checked in again texting ""hello.""Finally at 3:19 a.m. Thibou answered ""my phone was dead who was that?""At 3:22 a.m. Lloyd responded ""Nfl."" A minute later he sent his last text ""just so u know.""During grand jury testimony Thibou admitted she thought her brother was bragging.When reliving the moment when police came to her home to tell her family that Lloyd had been shot to death Thibou began to cry silently wiping her tears after Assistant District Attorney William McCauley gave her a tissue.During cross-examination defense attorney Michael Fee introduced a photo of Lloyd taken by Thibou. It showed Lloyd smiling and sitting in the driver's seat of the black Suburban that Hernandez loaned him.Lloyd's bullet-riddled clothes shown to jurorsOn Wednesday jurors got an up-close view of the clothes Lloyd was wearing the night he was shot six times. Massachusetts crime lab forensic chemist Sherri Menendez held up Lloyd's bullet-riddled dark blue Old Navy sweatshirt and then his red plaid shirt. Jurors craned their necks to get a better view of the bullet holes in the sweatshirt. The shirt was stained with blood.Menendez tested the bullet holes for gunshot residue consisting of what she described as burned particles and vaporous lead. During her testing of bullet holes on the front of the sweatshirt she found both and was able to determine that Lloyd was shot from as close as 3 feet.The autopsy showed the final two shots were fired into his chest while he was laying face up in the ground.Details of Hernandez 'flophouse' come outJust weeks before Hernandez was arrested and charged with murder he toured rental apartments with New England Patriot employee Kevin Anderson real estate agent Barbara Scardino testified Thursday.She said she was initially contacted by Anderson to find some apartments to show Hernandez. He had previously called her to help other Patriot players find homes and apartment rentals sometimes second residences near Gillette Stadium. This means the Patriot staff knew about Hernandez's second home.In early May of 2013 she showed Anderson and Hernandez four apartments. Hernandez settled on the two-bedroom condo in Franklin Massachusetts referred to as his ""flophouse.""Hernandez's home in North Attleboro and his condo in Franklin are each about 15 minutes away from the stadium.Hernandez's Franklin neighbor Carol Bailey also took the stand telling jurors that she met another man that also stayed in the condo. It was Hernandez's friend Wallace.Bailey paid close attention to Hernandez and Wallace seeing them come and go during their short stay there. During her one attempt to talk to Hernandez and say hello she says he sort of grunted back calling it a ""nondescript"" noise. She also testified that she often heard loud voices that sounded ""locker room-ish"" coming from the apartment as well as a strong ""skunk-like"" smell seeping into her apartment from their shared wall.After mid-June she never saw him again.Cell phone tower tracking system explainedA representative from Sprint Justin Darrow started off the week with a light moment. He appeared nervous and stopped to take a moment while answering a question. He then turned to Judge Susan Garsh and apologized.""It's a big case. Sorry.""Showing no emotion Garsh struck the comment from the record.Darrow went on to testify to multiple calls between Sprint cell phone client Ernest Wallace and Odin Lloyd Aaron Hernandez and Hernandez's fiancee Shayanna Jenkins the night before and morning of Lloyd's death. Prosecutors say they believe Hernandez was using his fiancee's phone to call Wallace.Jenkins granted immunityDarrow also explained how cell sites (or towers) in the Sprint network tracked the phone calls and thus tracked the direction they were driving.Another cell phone representative also testified. T-Mobile engineer Patrick Quinn testified about the data transmissions from Lloyd's cell phone beginning on June 17 2013 at 2:32 a.m. That's when Lloyd was picked up outside his home in the Nissan Altima. Data transmissions are the automatic updates that are sent to cell phones.Assistant District Attorney Patrick Bomberg methodically walked Quinn through data transmissions received on Lloyd's cell phone via multiple cell towers along the route he traveled from Dorchester to the industrial park in North Attleboro. The last cell tower was just 400 yards from Lloyd's body.",41,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/03/10/boston-marathon-bombing-trial-to-focus-on-secret-twitter-account/,Boston Marathon bombing trial to focus on secret Twitter account,"Chilling video revealed in Boston marathon bombing trialNever autoplay videosA federal agent is expected to take the stand Tuesday at the Boston Marathon bombing trial and will reportedly focus on Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's secret Twitter account.MyFoxBoston.com reported that the account was used to post radical messages including one posted a day before the marathon reading ""It's our responsibility my brothers and sister to ask Allah to ease the hardships of the oppressed and give us victory over the kufr.""

She described chaos and remembers trying to shield her husband from viewing his leg. She says she didn't realize she was on fire until a man pushed her down and began extinguishing the flames.Kensky said her left leg was amputated right after the 2013 bombing. Her right leg was amputated in January.She testified that she desperately did not want to be a double amputee.""I wanted to paint my toenails and put my feet in the sand "" she told the jury. ""To lose my right leg was a gut-wrenching decision.""Three people were killed and more than 260 were injured.Tsarnaev's lawyer acknowledges he committed the crime but says his older brother recruited him.At the end of testimony prosecutors introduced into evidence a number of photographs taken before and after the bombing.One photo taken before the bombing captured Kensky and her husband in the crowd. Behind the couple in the same picture Tsarnaev could be seen.Jurors also watched a timeline video compiled by the FBI using surveillance video from stores and restaurants near the marathon finish line. The video which shows both brothers' movements around the time of the bombings focuses on Dzhokhar and shows him carrying a backpack up until he gets to the front of the Forum restaurant when he is shown dropping the bag from his shoulder.One frame then shows the backpack at his feet. The backpack is in a crowd of people and just feet from children standing on a metal barrier including 8-year-old Martin Richard who was killed and his younger sister Jane who lost a leg in the blast.As the first bomb explodes the video shows everyone in the crowd turning toward the blast. Tsarnaev does not look in that direction and instead begins to walk in the other direction.Seconds later the second bomb explodes and Tsarnaev who prosecutors say detonated the second bomb is seen running with a crowd of people who are also running.

He slouched in his chair as jurors watched videos of him both before and after two nail-packed pressure cooker bombs exploded killing three people claiming 17 limbs and hurting more than 260 others.He didn't utter a peep as his tweets and words he had scribbled on the side of a pleasure boat flashed up on a big screen and were quoted in court.At issue: Was Tsarnaev a terrorist looking to punish the United States for policies he believed were harmful to Muslims? Or was he a goofball stoner who simply followed the lead of his older more radical brother?The defense team tried to portray Tsarnaev as a confused college kid who like countless others watches Comedy Central and cracks crass jokes. ""I wanna study a broad or two "" he posted on his Twitter account as @J_tsar. He jokes about not seeing commercials featuring the Trix rabbit and about ""whale watching"" outside a McDonald's fast-food restaurant.Miriam Conrad a member of his defense team tried Tuesday to apply a more benign spin on tweets the government contends show him as a would-be jihadist eager for martyrdom and a free pass to paradise.His brother was dead and police knew who he was; they were scouring the Boston suburb of Watertown for Tsarnaev when he slipped under a tarp and climbed aboard the Slip Away II a fishing boat dry-docked in a Watertown backyard. He hid for hours before being discovered.Boston Marathon bombing evidence photos 9 photosEXPAND GALLERYBleeding he picked up a pencil and wrote what Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb called his ""manifesto.""Tsarnaev wrote he was jealous that his brother Tamerlan had achieved paradise by dying like a holy warrior; he was killed the night before during a gunbattle with police. The indictment against him says Tsarnaev helped in his brother's demise by running him over and dragging him along the road as he tried to run down police.About the bombings Tsarnaev wrote on the boat that he didn't enjoy killing innocent civilians but that circumstances excused it.""The US Government is killing our innocent civilians but most of you already know that "" he wrote. ""Know you are fighting men who look into the barrel of your gun and see heaven now how can you compete with that. We are promised victory and we will surely get it.""Streaks of blood cover portions of his message. More than a dozen bullet holes obliterate parts of words. So ended one of the biggest manhunts in U.S. history.While in the boat he wrote that he couldn't stand to see the U.S. government ""go unpunished"" for killing Muslims. ""We Muslims are one body you hurt one you hurt us all.""He ended with: ""Now I don't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in Islam but due to said "" -- the word was lost to a bullet hole -- ""it is allowed.""Tsarnaev's connections: Who's whoJudge George O'Toole viewed the boat Tuesday afternoon so he could rule on a defense request to show the entire boat ""in context"" to the jury.

The judge overseeing the murder trial of former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez has denied a defense request to strike testimony from an employee of firearms manufacturer Glock who said surveillance video showed Hernandez carrying a gun through his home less than 10 minutes after the killing.Hernandez lawyer James Sultan on Thursday asked for Wednesday's testimony to be stricken but Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh denied the request.Kyle Aspinwall's testimony was the most conclusive to date that puts a weapon in Hernandez's hand around the time of the slaying.Hernandez is charged with murder in the killing of Odin Lloyd who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee.Aspinwall says video surveillance also showed Hernandez carrying a gun a few hours before the killing.,http://us.cnn.com/2015/03/06/us/hernandez-trial-key-moments/index.html,Aaron Hernandez trial: What you missed,"Story highlightsTestimony this week focused on DNA fingerprints and tire treadsMother tells Susan Candiotti that court ""went very well"" for HernandezJurors also heard details about cell phone records and cell towers(CNN)Five full weeks into Aaron Hernandez's murder trial prosecutors have called 77 witnesses. Jurors have yet to hear from the former NFL star's fiance Shayanna Jenkins New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick or owner Robert Kraft.But this week did bring emotional testimony and important developments in the case against Hernandez who has pleaded not guilty to killing Odin Lloyd in 2013.Check out some of the key moments you might have missed this week.DNA said linked to Hernandez LloydA DNA analyst from the Massachusetts State Police crime lab said she found that Hernandez's DNA matched the DNA taken from a marijuana joint found near Lloyd's body at the crime scene. Lloyd's DNA also was found on the blunt.The DNA analyst Diane Biagiotti testified to finding a partial DNA match from Hernandez on the shell casing found in the dumpster of the Enterprise rental car office. But under cross-examination lead defense attorney Jamie Sultan got Biagiotti to acknowledge there's a high likelihood that DNA from chewing gum could have transferred to the shell casing found in the dumpster.The office manager at the rental car office Keelia Smyth testified that she put the shell casing and the gum together after finding the items in the Nissan Altima returned by Hernandez on June 17 2013. She said she threw them in the trash bin outside of her office.Inside Hernandez's downward spiralIt was revealed by Sultan that the state never submitted the gum for DNA testing. The state has not yet explained why. We may hear the answer during the state's redirect of Biagiotti on Monday. Hernandez is seen on surveillance video buying gum and he also offered some to Smyth.Biagiotti said under cross-examination that it's highly unlikely to find DNA on any shell casing. One reason is because the heat from the gun wipes away any DNA she said. The shell casings found at the crime scene did not have enough DNA on them to produce a DNA profile.Police: Hernandez 'agitated' and 'upset' after murder 02:29PLAY VIDEOHernandez's family was in court on Friday after a week's absence. Hernandez's mother Terri Hernandez told CNN' that she thought Friday ""went very well"" for him.Fingerprints tire treadsTestimony this week also focused on fingerprints from Hernandez and Lloyd that were found inside the rented Nissan Altima.The car also had fingerprints of Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz who are also charged with killing Lloyd. They have pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately.State Trooper David Mackin a fingerprint expert with the Massachusetts State Police crime scene services reported finding the fingerprints of Wallace and Ortiz in a Chrysler 300 that Hernandez rented. Prosecutors call it the ""getaway car "" which was ultimately found abandoned in Bristol Connecticut.But no prints were found on the .22-caliber gun recovered on the edge of a wooded area near Hernandez's home. Hernandez is charged with illegal possession of that gun.In addition no prints were found on any of the shell casings including the casing found stuck to the blue bubblegum in the dumpster outside the Enterprise office.Another key find: tire treads of the rear passenger tire of the Altima matched a tire impression found at the crime scene according to court testimony.Lloyd's sister testifies about texts she received from himShaquilla Thibou Lloyd's younger sister and the last family member to see him before he was killed took the stand Monday.About an hour before his death she said she watched him get into a silver Nissan Altima as she sat in a friend's car outside her home.Thibou who was 19 at the time of her brother's killing told jurors that when Lloyd first walked to the car he opened the front passenger door. He stopped and then opened the back passenger door and entered the car.Chilling crime scene video in Hernandez case 02:44PLAY VIDEO""The light came on and there was a shadow in the back seat "" she said.Then she saw the Altima pull away. It was 2:32 a.m.Thirty minutes later Thibou returned to her home and charged her dead phone. She noticed a text from her big brother.Thibou was not allowed to share with jurors what was said in those texts. The judge ruled there is not enough proof the text message meant Lloyd feared for his life legally called ""a dying declaration.""That means that the jury did not hear that at 3:07 a.m. Lloyd texted his sister asking ""U saw who I'm with?""At 3:11 a.m he checked in again texting ""hello.""Finally at 3:19 a.m. Thibou answered ""my phone was dead who was that?""At 3:22 a.m. Lloyd responded ""Nfl."" A minute later he sent his last text ""just so u know.""During grand jury testimony Thibou admitted she thought her brother was bragging.When reliving the moment when police came to her home to tell her family that Lloyd had been shot to death Thibou began to cry silently wiping her tears after Assistant District Attorney William McCauley gave her a tissue.During cross-examination defense attorney Michael Fee introduced a photo of Lloyd taken by Thibou. It showed Lloyd smiling and sitting in the driver's seat of the black Suburban that Hernandez loaned him.Lloyd's bullet-riddled clothes shown to jurorsOn Wednesday jurors got an up-close view of the clothes Lloyd was wearing the night he was shot six times. Massachusetts crime lab forensic chemist Sherri Menendez held up Lloyd's bullet-riddled dark blue Old Navy sweatshirt and then his red plaid shirt. Jurors craned their necks to get a better view of the bullet holes in the sweatshirt. The shirt was stained with blood.Menendez tested the bullet holes for gunshot residue consisting of what she described as burned particles and vaporous lead. During her testing of bullet holes on the front of the sweatshirt she found both and was able to determine that Lloyd was shot from as close as 3 feet.The autopsy showed the final two shots were fired into his chest while he was laying face up in the ground.Details of Hernandez 'flophouse' come outJust weeks before Hernandez was arrested and charged with murder he toured rental apartments with New England Patriot employee Kevin Anderson real estate agent Barbara Scardino testified Thursday.She said she was initially contacted by Anderson to find some apartments to show Hernandez. He had previously called her to help other Patriot players find homes and apartment rentals sometimes second residences near Gillette Stadium. This means the Patriot staff knew about Hernandez's second home.In early May of 2013 she showed Anderson and Hernandez four apartments. Hernandez settled on the two-bedroom condo in Franklin Massachusetts referred to as his ""flophouse.""Hernandez's home in North Attleboro and his condo in Franklin are each about 15 minutes away from the stadium.Hernandez's Franklin neighbor Carol Bailey also took the stand telling jurors that she met another man that also stayed in the condo. It was Hernandez's friend Wallace.Bailey paid close attention to Hernandez and Wallace seeing them come and go during their short stay there. During her one attempt to talk to Hernandez and say hello she says he sort of grunted back calling it a ""nondescript"" noise. She also testified that she often heard loud voices that sounded ""locker room-ish"" coming from the apartment as well as a strong ""skunk-like"" smell seeping into her apartment from their shared wall.After mid-June she never saw him again.Cell phone tower tracking system explainedA representative from Sprint Justin Darrow started off the week with a light moment. He appeared nervous and stopped to take a moment while answering a question. He then turned to Judge Susan Garsh and apologized.""It's a big case. Sorry.""Showing no emotion Garsh struck the comment from the record.Darrow went on to testify to multiple calls between Sprint cell phone client Ernest Wallace and Odin Lloyd Aaron Hernandez and Hernandez's fiancee Shayanna Jenkins the night before and morning of Lloyd's death. Prosecutors say they believe Hernandez was using his fiancee's phone to call Wallace.Jenkins granted immunityDarrow also explained how cell sites (or towers) in the Sprint network tracked the phone calls and thus tracked the direction they were driving.Another cell phone representative also testified. T-Mobile engineer Patrick Quinn testified about the data transmissions from Lloyd's cell phone beginning on June 17 2013 at 2:32 a.m. That's when Lloyd was picked up outside his home in the Nissan Altima. Data transmissions are the automatic updates that are sent to cell phones.Assistant District Attorney Patrick Bomberg methodically walked Quinn through data transmissions received on Lloyd's cell phone via multiple cell towers along the route he traveled from Dorchester to the industrial park in North Attleboro. The last cell tower was just 400 yards from Lloyd's body.",43,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/03/13/ferguson-keeps-calm-night-after-shooting-police-officers/,Ferguson keeps calm night after shooting of police officers,"March 12 2015: Members of the St. Louis County Police Department walk through a crowd of protesters trying to move them out of the street in front of the Ferguson Police Department. (AP Photo/Jeff Roberson)FERGUSON Mo.  Protesters called for calm but vowed to keep pushing for change in Ferguson a day after the shooting of two officers in front of the city's police department heightened tensions in the St. Louis suburb.Dozens gathered for a candlelight vigil Thursday night where they expressed sympathy for the wounded officers. They also prayed for peace as Ferguson moves forward in the wake of a scathing Justice Department report on racial bias in its law-enforcement practices.A larger crowd of about 200 protesters gathered later outside the police department but the scene was a marked contrast to the previous night when fights broke out before the shootings.Some called for specific changes: the resignation of Ferguson's mayor or the disbanding of the police department. Others were there to remember 18-year-old Michael Brown whose shooting death by a Ferguson police officer in August made the city a national focal point.""We'll not be derailed in the pursuit of justice by anybody or anything that wants to get in our way "" said the Rev. Traci Blackmon a member of the state's Ferguson Commission who led the prayer vigil at a public plaza in downtown Ferguson near the police department. ""We refuse to stop.""Officers from the St. Louis County Police Department and the Missouri Highway Patrol were summoned to bolster security but largely stood idle in the distance. The protesters had largely disbanded by 11:30 p.m. No arrests were made.The shootings just after midnight on Thursday came as protesters had gathered after the resignation of the city's embattled police chief. They marked the first time in more than seven months of tension in Ferguson that officers were shot at a protest and the bloodshed threatened to inflame the already fraught relationship between police and demonstrators.Both wounded officers were released from the hospital Thursday but St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar -- who called the attack an ambush -- said they could have been killed. One was shot in the right shoulder the bullet exiting through his back. The other in the right cheek just below the eye. The bullet lodged behind his ear.Several people were taken in for questioning but were later released and no arrests were made by late Thursday. The shots were believed to come from a handgun across the street from the police department.The gunman may have fired from up to 120 yards away a distance longer than a football field. But with a line of roughly 20 officers standing in front of the building the shooter did not have to be particularly accurate to hit two of them Belmar said.In Washington President Barack Obama took to Twitter to relay his prayers to the officers and to denounce violence against police. ""Path to justice is one all of us must travel together "" Obama wrote signing the tweet with his initials to indicate the president personally composed it.Attorney General Eric Holder said the gunman was ""a damn punk"" who was ""trying to sow discord in an area that was trying to get its act together trying to bring together a community that had been fractured for too long.""In a statement Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III and the city council said that although they respect the right to protest peacefully ""we cannot continue to move forward under threats of violence and destruction to our community. We ask our residents and clergy in this area to partner with us as we make our way through this process.""The calls for healing and reconciliation weren't received favorably by all. As participants gathered before the prayer vigil Thursday night shouts of ""white power"" came from a passing pickup truck.Brown's August shooting by former Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson prompted protests locally and across the nation and tensions escalated in November after a county grand jury declined to prosecute Wilson. Justice Department investigators concurred with that finding in a report released March 4.The Justice Department also released a separate report that day that found racial profiling in the city police force and a municipal court system driven by profit largely on the backs of black and low-income residents.Police Chief Tom Jackson's resignation on Wednesday marked the sixth departure or firing in the week since the release of that report. Ferguson's court clerk was fired and the municipal judge two police officers and the city manager voluntarily stepped aside. Wilson resigned in November.

Identifying the shooter or shooters is the No. 1 priority of St. Louis County police he said.Whoever shot the officers was there ""for whatever nefarious reason it was"" to inflict harm Belmar said.Belmar also gave details about the officers' injuries:-- One of them -- an officer from Webster Groves Missouri -- was shot ""at the high point"" of his cheek under his right eye and the bullet is now lodged behind one of his ears Belmar said.-- The other officer struck from St. Louis County was shot in his shoulder and the bullet came out the middle of his back according to Belmar.The two police officers were standing next to each other in front of the Ferguson Missouri police department when they were hit around midnight Belmar said.Authorities believe a handgun was used to shoot the two officers Belmar said ""based on the way the shots sounded and the injuries to the police officers.""He said that shell casings had been recovered in the area of the shooting but ""we don't know 100% yet if those are going to be the shell casings that are going to be attributed to this shooting.""Officers shot amid Ferguson protests 10 photosEXPAND GALLERYAlso Thursday morning U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder decried the shootings as a ""heinous assault (that) was inexcusable and repugnant.""Calling the shooting a ""cowardly action "" Holder said ""I condemn violence against any public safety officials in the strongest terms and the Department of Justice will never accept any threats or violence directed at those who serve and protect our communities.""[Original story posted at 9:23 a.m. ET]Two police officers standing guard outside the Ferguson Missouri police department were shot early Thursday morning spurring a manhunt for those responsible and stirring questions about what's next for protesters who have been a constant presence in the city since Michael Brown's death in August.Dozens of demonstrators came out again on Wednesday night reacting to the announcement hours earlier of Ferguson police Chief Thomas Jackson's resignation. The few who remained were dispersing when shots rang out just after midnight -- fired from a hill a distance away from where the protesters had gathered according to witnesses.DeRay McKesson told CNN he has no ""indication that leads me to believe that this was a protester who did it "" saying he and fellow protesters believe in nonviolence.Yet St. Louis County police Chief Jon Belmar believes someone targeted the police.""These police officers were standing there and they were shot just because they were police officers "" he said.New video captures gunfire in Ferguson 01:14PLAY VIDEOThe Ferguson Police Department has been the focus of protests since one of its officers Darren Wilson fatally shot Brown on August 9 -- after which a local grand jury declined to indict Wilson on any charges and federal prosecutors decided not to press civil rights charges.Neither of the two officers shot early Thursday however was with the Ferguson police.One a 14-year veteran of the St. Louis County Police Department was shot in the shoulder. The other a 7-year veteran of the Webster Groves Police Department was struck in the face Belmar said.Both officers were in serious condition Thursday morning. Authorities described their injuries as non-life threatening.From calm to chaosFor some protesters Wednesday was a day to celebrate: They'd called for Jackson's resignation for months and finally it was happening.But for others it was not enough. They demanded more changes including disbanding the entire police department and the resignation of Mayor James Knowles. The now familiar racial overtones hung over the protests a result of the fact that Wilson is white while Brown was black as well as the U.S. Justice Department report that found a pattern of racial discrimination in the Ferguson Police Department.Fight back.

The Associated Press citing a senior U.S. official reported that the letter which was signed by 47 of 54 GOP members first came up in negotiations on Sunday and was raised again Monday in discussions led by Secretary of State John Kerry and Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif.Zarif was quoted by Iranian state media after the meeting as saying the topics included the potential speed of a softening of U.S. economic sanctions and the new issue of the letter from the senators. ""It is necessary that the stance of the U.S. administration be defined about this move "" he was quoted as saying.Kerry and Zarif met for nearly five hours in Lausanne the start of several planned days of discussions. Most of the Iranians then departed for Brussels where they were to meet with European negotiators.In Brussels EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini said that ""we are entering a crucial time a crucial two weeks."" And German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said that after ""more than 10 years of negotiations we should seize this opportunity.""""There are areas where we've made progress areas where we have yet to make any progress "" British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said. ""But the fact that we're all here talking shows the commitment on both sides to try to reach an agreement.""In Lausanne the U.S. official wouldn't say how much time the sides spent talking about the letter drafted seven days ago by freshman Sen. Tom Cotton R-Ark. The Iranians have called the letter a propaganda ploy and Zarif joked last week that some U.S. legislators didn't understand their own Constitution. The Obama administration has called the letter ""ill timed"" and ""ill advised "" coming weeks before the deadline for a preliminary agreement with Iran on its nuclear program.Cotton isn't backing down. In his maiden speech in the Senate Cotton reiterated his view that the deal being discussed would pave Iran's path to a nuclear bomb.""Iran is an outlaw regime. ... Unsurprising Iran is only growing bolder and more aggressive as America retreats from the Middle East "" Cotton said adding that Iranian leaders continue to call for Israel's elimination and that Iran is meddling in other nations including Syria and Iraq.The U.S. official in Lausanne who wasn't authorized to speak publicly on the matter and briefed reporters only on condition of anonymity said that in the end the talks and a potential agreement depend on Iran showing the world that its nuclear program is exclusively peaceful.The goal for a full agreement is the end of June.Republicans argue that a deal would be insufficient and unenforceable allowing Iran to eventually become a nuclear-armed state. To that end they've delivered a series of proposals to undercut or block an agreement including ones that would require Senate say-so on a deal and order new sanctions against Iran while negotiations are underway.Cotton's letter the administration and congressional Democrats argue went further interfering in the president's execution of U.S. foreign policy. The letter styled as a U.S. civics lesson warned Iranian leaders that any deal negotiated by the current administration could be tossed by Obama's successor.Obama and other officials insist they're not going to make any deal that would allow Iran to acquire nuclear weapons.The agreement taking shape would limit Iran's uranium enrichment and other nuclear activity for at least a decade with the restrictions slowly lifted over several years. Washington and other world powers also would gradually scale back sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy. Tehran says it is only interested in peaceful energy generation and medical research but much of the world suspects it harbors nuclear weapons ambitions.Kerry and Zarif plan to regroup in Lausanne on Tuesday. The U.S. secretary of state is to return to Washington by week's end for talks with Afghanistan's leaders and the Iranians plan to break for the Persian New Year. Officials say talks might restart sometime next week if necessary. A deal would also require the approval of America's negotiating partners: Britain China France Germany and Russia.With little time remaining before the end of March some officials have said the persistent differences mean negotiators will likely settle for an announcement that they've made enough progress to justify further talks.Such a declaration would hardly satisfy U.S. critics of the Obama administration's efforts. But the senior American official said the goal was to determine by the end of March ""if we can get to a political framework that addresses the major elements of a comprehensive deal.""Back in Washington Sen. Bob Corker R-Tenn. chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said his panel will likely vote on a bill next week that would require a congressional review of any nuclear deal. The measure would require the president to submit the text of any pact to Congress and bar the administration from suspending congressional sanctions on Iran for 60 days. In that time Congress would hold hearings and have a chance to approve disapprove or take no action on the agreement.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",http://us.cnn.com/2015/03/18/politics/benjamin-netanyahu-israel-elections-obama/index.html,U.S. support for Israel could slip after Netanyahu victory,"Washington (CNN)While supporters of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spent Wednesday celebrating his surprise victory at the polls the Obama administration took a much dimmer view of the results.A senior administration official said that Netanyahu's sharp tacks to the right before Tuesday's vote -- in which he ruled out the creation of a Palestinian state a pillar of U.S. policy in the Middle East -- ""raise very significant substantive concerns"" for the White House and that ""we have to reassess our options going forward.""Israel votes 14 photosEXPAND GALLERYAnother senior U.S. official told CNN that Netanyahu's nixing of Palestinian statehood ""could change things"" for the U.S.-Israel relationship.That official said the administration is waiting to see if Netanyahu walks back his comments.

How their troubled relationship will affect cooperation on the high-stakes issues facing both countries -- Iran's nuclear program regional violence and the future of the Palestinians -- remains to be seen. But some in Washington warn that it could diminish America's historic support for Israel at the U.N. as well as any White House ambitions of brokering further Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.Instead of Obama it was Secretary of State John Kerry who called Netanyahu Wednesday to congratulate him on his victory.

Tsarnaev is charged with conspiring with his brother to place two bombs near the Boston Marathon finish line in April 2013 killing three and injuring more than 260 people. (AP Photo/Jane Flavell Collins) (The Associated Press)BOSTON  Three police officers dramatically recounted how Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother hurled bombs at them during a violent confrontation days after the deadly 2013 attack.The testimony by the Watertown officers on Monday came hours after jurors in Tsarnaev's federal death penalty trial went to see the bullet-ridden boat in which he was found hiding the evening of April 19 2013.The police officers described their battle with the two brothers and Dzhokhar's furious escape in a stolen car in which he ended up dragging his brother Tamerlan's body through the street.Earlier that day shortly after midnight an officer spotted a carjacked Mercedes SUV on a quiet residential street. That set off a frenzied clash in which both brothers hurled explosives at police including two pipe bombs and one pressure-cooker bomb similar to those used near the marathon finish line that killed 3 people and injured more than 260 others the officers testified.Joseph Reynolds the first officer at the scene said he ""locked eyes"" with the SUV driver who was later identified as Tamerlan. Reynolds said Tamerlan got out of the car and began firing at him.He saw a wick and a lighter and then watched as an object flew through the air landed in the street and exploded he said shaking him.""I could feel all the debris landing on top of me "" he said.Sgt. Jeffrey Pugliese said he cut through backyards to get closer to the bombers and he eventually could see their feet illuminated by car headlights. He said he aimed at the ground near their feet in the hope that the bullets would ricochet into their ankles.But Tamerlan saw him and came charging up the street firing at him said Pugliese who fired back.The two men came face to face with only 6 to 8 feet separating them Pugliese said. But Tamerlan had a problem with his pistol the officer said.""He kind of looked at his gun. He looked at me. We looked at each other "" Pugliese said. ""I think out of frustration he threw his gun at me.""Pugliese said he tackled him Tamerlan who struggled as three officers tried to handcuff him even though he was wounded and bleeding.That's when they saw the stolen car speeding toward them with Dzhokhar behind the wheel Pugliese said.Dzhokhar ran over his brother and dragged his body 25 to 30 feet Pugliese said. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died of gunshot wounds and the injuries he suffered when he was hit by the car.After a massive manhunt and door-to-door search Dzhokhar was found hiding in a boat parked in a backyard in Watertown. The owner of the boat is expected to testify Tuesday.The boat was brought to a location in South Boston so the jury could see it. The Associated Press was one of two news organizations and three courtroom sketch artists allowed to see the boat and provide pool coverage for the media.The 18 jurors walked around the outside of the boat and peered inside while Tsarnaev flanked by three attorneys and U.S. marshals watched impassively from a table about 50 feet away.The red and white boat is covered with more than 100 bullet holes marked individually with small pieces of white evidence tape. Inside the boat the note Tsarnaev wrote denouncing the U.S. for its wars in Muslim countries was visible. The note written in pencil was speckled with bullet holes and stained with blood.Tsarnaev's lawyer admitted during opening statements that he participated in the bombings and the later crimes but said Tamerlan was the mastermind who recruited the then 19-year-old Dzhokhar to help him.Prosecutors say Tsarnaev was a full and willing participant. Now 21 he faces the possibility of the death penalty if convicted.",http://us.cnn.com/2015/03/16/us/boston-marathon-bombing-trial/index.html,Police describe fierce gun battle with Boston Marathon bombing suspects,"Story highlights3 police officers described an intense gun battle with Boston Marathon bomb suspectsThey said the 2 men shot at them threw bombs and tried to run them overJurors see the boat where Dzhokhar Tsarnaev hid before his arrestBoston (CNN)Eight minutes of sheer terror.That's what police officers from Watertown Massachusetts described in heart-stopping detail Monday revealing details of a chaotic shootout with the Boston Marathon bombing suspects.One of the suspects Tamerlan Tsarnaev died from injuries he sustained that day -- wounded in a gun battle then run over by his brother Dzhokhar.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev managed to escape but was later caught by police. Now he's on trial facing 30 charges for the marathon bombings which killed three people and injured more than 260 others.The shootout with police in the early morning hours of April 19 2013 marked one of the most dramatic chapters in the manhunt for the suspects who paralyzed the Boston metropolitan area for days.It started patrolman Joseph Reynolds testified soon after he locked eyes with Tamerlan Tsarnaev who he spotted driving an SUV that matched a description of a stolen vehicle. Reynolds called for backup.It wasn't long before Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev were firing guns throwing bombs and trying to run officers over with a stolen SUV Reynolds said.""Tamerlan Tsarnaev got out of the driver's side door and began shooting at my cruiser "" Reynolds said.Soon the officer said he ran out of bullets.Sgt. Jeffrey Pugliese saw what looked like muzzle flashes as soon as he arrived at the scene.""I put my vehicle in park I took a round through the windshield I was sprayed with glass and I knew OK we were being fired on "" said Sgt. John MacLellan.Then the two brothers began throwing improvised explosives including pipe bombs and a pressure cooker bomb the officers testified.""I noticed one was bigger than the other and they had different styles when they were throwing the devices "" MacLellan said. ""One was throwing like a baseball.""MacLellan said the pressure cooker bomb ""was incredibly loud. I had to holster my weapon. My eyes were shaking violently in my head. I couldn't see.""Pugliese said he opened fire when he saw one of the men Tamerlan Tsarnaev charging toward him.Pugliese fired and the man threw his pistol at the officer hitting him in the bicep. Pugliese tackled him. And with Tamerlan Tsarnaev who was wounded from gunfire on the ground the three officers tried to put him in handcuffs.They thought they'd be able to arrest him. But then something changed.""We were wrestling with Tamerlan and all of a sudden I could hear an engine revving "" Reynolds saidThe SUV Reynolds said was heading straight toward the officers.'He could have sped off and run away'The dramatic descriptions of the shootout Monday sounded like a scene from a Hollywood film said Boston Globe columnist Kevin Cullen.But the most extraordinary revelation in court he said was that the night could have ended very differently.""Dzhokhar Tsarnaev did not have to go back and run his brother over. He actually did a three-point turn and reversed the vehicle. He could have sped off and run away "" Cullen told CNN's ""The Lead with Jake Tapper."" He was in a much better position to flee. But apparently he decided to do a U-turn and come back.""The sight of the stolen SUV speeding toward them caught the officers by surprise.""I reached down and I grabbed Tamerlan by the back of the belt and tried to drag him out of the street so he wouldn't be hit "" Pugliese said. ""The black SUV it was right in my face. ... I kind of laid back and felt the wind from the vehicle as it went by.""But they didn't move Tamerlan in time. His body became hung up in the rear wheels and he was dragged a short distance Pugliese said.The prosecutor asked Pugliese if there was something in the road that forced the SUV driver to go directly at the officers.""No "" he said. ""It was accelerating at a very high rate of speed.""Later that day Tamerlan Tsarnaev was pronounced dead at a local hospital with the cause listed as ""traumatic injuries"" to the head and torso. His fingerprints led to the identification of the suspects.Officers discovered that Richard Donohue a Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority officer had been hit by friendly fire during the shootout. He survived but nearly bled to death.Jurors travel off-site to see boat hideawayDzhokhar Tsarnaev was arrested about 8:45 p.m. that same day hiding in a boat called the ""Slip Away"" that was stowed in a backyard in Watertown.Jurors saw photos of the boat last week. But on Monday they got a chance to see the boat which has become a key piece of evidence in the trial in person.Before the trial started prosecutors and defense attorneys had sparred over how much of the boat jurors would get to see.The prosecution sought to remove a panel on which Tsarnaev allegedly scrawled incriminating messages so that jurors could see it with their own eyes. Defense attorney David Bruck argued that cutting out a panel would take the written words out of context and wouldn't fairly reflect Tsarnaev's state of mind.In South Boston about a mile from the courthouse jurors intently looked at the entire boat Monday. It had been loaded onto a semi truck and moved to the location for viewing by the jury.In this courtroom sketch the boat in which Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was captured is depicted on a trailer for observation during Tsarnaev's federal death penalty trial Monday March 16 2015 in Boston. Tsarnaev is charged with conspiring with his brother to place two bombs near the Boston Marathon finish line in April 2013 killing three and injuring more than 260 people.Dzhokhar Tsarnaev wearing a dark jacket and no handcuffs or shackles watched the jurors but showed little emotion or expression.Jurors appeared to strain to make out the words Tsarnaev scrawled inside the boat.Photos of what prosecutors say are Dzhokhar Tsarnaev writings on the inside of the boat he was captured in after running from police in the aftermath of the Boston Bombing.

A young man who answered the door Tuesday afternoon declined to identify himself and said the fraternity had no comment.Police said anyone who posted the photos could face misdemeanor charges of harassment or invasion of privacy with a fine being the most likely penalty.According to the warrant the fraternity's page had 144 active members that included both students and alumni.State College police said they first fielded the complaint on Jan. 18 and reported the matter to university administrators on March 3.The informant's computer ""yielded information on two victims whose images would rise to the level of criminal action "" State College police Lt. Keith Robb said Tuesday.Facebook was contacted to disable the site and to obtain more information for the investigation Robb said.Some of the postings involved nude women in ""sexual or embarrassing positions "" the warrant reads. ""It appears from the photos provided that the individuals in the photos are not aware that the photos had been taken.""Penn State's Interfraternity Council planned a full review of Kappa Delta Rho's conduct.According to the ex-fraternity member who went to police a second page dubbed ""2.0"" was started in about April 2014 after a woman depicted on the first Facebook page called ""Covert Business Transactions "" complained.The informant said the woman was visiting the fraternity when a member accidentally left his Facebook page logged in and she noticed a topless photograph of her had been posted to the group.Robb told the AP she wanted the photo removed but did not wish to press charges.""A lot of that is probably what we're going to end up with people who don't want anything done just these photos removed "" Robb said. ""That's already done.""The investigation was first reported by WJAC-TV in Johnstown.Penn State's director of student conduct Danny Shaha told reporters that students are still living in the fraternity house. He said the house is privately owned giving the university little control over it.The photographs accompanying the warrant included images of fully nude and partly clothed women and a scene of a man appearing to grope a woman her pants partly pulled down.Police said some of the copies of the warrant sent to news outlets included images of the victims and authorities asked that those images not be released. They said the photos were sent in error.The informant who visited the police station provided police with brief explanations for individual photos. One he said showed a woman vomiting in a member's room. Another showed ""the type of stuff that happens at KDR."" Two other images showed strippers hired by the fraternity for a party.Some of the posts included with the warrant were images of cellphone text exchanges including one from a woman apparently concerned about a casual sexual encounter the night before and whether birth control was used.",http://us.cnn.com/2015/03/18/us/fraternities-boys-behaving-badly/index.html,Rape  nude photos  racist behavior: Do fraternities make men behave badly?,"Story highlightsSome say fraternities are good for community serviceOthers say they fuel self-segregation on college campuses(CNN)Despite roots in community service and brotherhood inappropriate behavior at fraternities can be so common that often no one blinks an eye.But a spate of recent disgraces -- from racist lyrics to nude photos of incapacitated women -- have prompted suspensions expulsions and a much more serious look at what some fraternities really stand for.""I happen to believe fraternities and sororities are a good thing.

The national leadership of the fraternity put the chapter on administrative suspension after the death and says the chapter is cooperating with the investigation WLTX said.Here's a more in-depth take on the incidents that have been happening nationwide:Nude photosKappa Delta Rho Penn State UniversityPenn State fraternity suspended over Facebook page 01:32Photos of nude and partially clothed women some apparently unconscious allegedly were posted on a private Facebook page by members of the university's Kappa Delta Rho chapter.A former member of Kappa Delta Rho alerted police to the page telling them in January that it had been used by members to share photos of ""unsuspecting victims drug sales and hazing "" according to a copy of a police affidavit.""No arrests are being made at this time "" State College Police Lt.

""Unfortunately we aren't able to identify any suspects right now because the accounts on Facebook were sanitized wiped clean.""In the meantime the chapter has been suspended for one year.Calling the evidence gathered so far ""appalling offensive and inconsistent with our community values "" University President Eric J.

The 10-minute descent was described as unusually rapid but possibly controlled though it left the plane too low to navigate the mountains.

Germanwings official Thomas Winkelmann said at a Tuesday news conference hours after the crash that the pilot had more than 10 years' experience and that the plane had been thoroughly inspected a day earlier. We will do everything possible the clarify the causes of the accident as quickly as possible Winkelmann said. ""We want to know what happened. That is our obligation.AFP reported that the plane had issued a distress call at 10:47 a.m. local time. Eric Heraud a spokesman for France's civil aviation authority told The New York Times that the pilots declared an emergency during a rapid descent although that was later called into question and Germanwings officials could not immediately say whether a call was made.

He declined to go into details. 9:56 a.m. ET: As a general practice pilots in the Lufthansa group do not undergo psychological testing Spohr said Thursday. 9:51 a.m.: Lufthansa does ""not have any clues"" about why the co-pilot crashed the plane that went down in the French Alps on Tuesday Lufthansa CEO Spohr said. 9:47 a.m.: It's not clear whether the Germanwings captain entered a code to try to get back into the cockpit or whether the co-pilot in the cockpit had ""put the lever on lock"" that would have prevented the code from working even if the captain had entered it Spohr said.The co-pilot 28-year-old German national Andreas Lubitz had ""interrupted"" his training for several months and then completed it which is not unusual Spohr said.Lubitz passed all flight examinations and medical examinations and was ""100% fit to fly "" Spohr said.Full story:It seems to have been no accident officials said Wednesday.Information collected by investigators suggests the co-pilot who was in control of the Germanwings airplane when it crashed killing all 150 people on board was acting deliberately the prosecutor said Thursday.The co-pilot apparently ""wanted to destroy the aircraft "" Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said.Lufthansa officials are ""speechless that this aircraft has been deliberately crashed by the co-pilot "" CEO Carsten Spohr said. The company owns Germanwings.It's unknown whether the co-pilot planned his actions in advance Robin said. But the co-pilot 28-year-old German national Andreas Lubitz ""took advantage"" of a moment in which the pilot left the cockpit.Screaming could be heard on the audio recording only in the last few minutes and death was instantaneous for those on board when the plane crashed Robin said.The horrific description seemed to leave the prosecutor at a loss for words. It is not being described as a ""terrorist attack "" and the killing of 150 people would generally not be described as a ""suicide"" either Robin said.Lubitz was not known to be on any terrorism list and his religion was not immediately known Robin said.The picture of the plane's final minutes comes largely from what was discovered in the mangled cockpit voice recorder.The co-pilot ""activated the descent"" of the plane when he was alone in the cockpit Robin said. That can only be done deliberately he said.The most plausible explanation of the crash is that the co-pilot ""through deliberate abstention refused to open the cabin door ... to the chief pilot and used the button"" to cause the plane to lose altitude Robin said.The co-pilot was ""fully qualified to pilot the aircraft on his own "" Robin added. The audio recording showed his breathing to be steady with no sign that he had a heart attack or other medical issue.He only had about 100 hours of experience on the type of aircraft he was flying but he had all the necessary certifications and qualifications to pilot the aircraft alone the prosecutor said.The bodies of the Germanwings crash victims will not be released until all DNA identification work has been done -- a process likely to last several weeks Robin said.Robin said he had told the families of the crash victims all the same information he was telling reporters at the news conference.The families of the two pilots are also in France but are not in the same place as the relatives he said.Robin emphasized that his conclusions were preliminary.Second 'black box' still lostFinding the plane's second ""black box"" will also be critical to understanding the mystery of what went on inside the jet.That box the flight data recorder hasn't been found yet but Lufthansa CEO Carsten Spohr said Wednesday that there's a high probability it will be.The mountainous terrain where the Germanwings jet went down is difficult to access.Senior executives from Germanwings and Lufthansa are also due to give a news conference Thursday.The Germanwings media office told CNN the captain of Flight 9525 had more than 6 000 hours of flight time. He has been with Germanwings since May 2014 and had worked with Lufthansa and Condor before then.The co-pilot has been with Germanwings since September 2013 and had completed 630 hours of flight time the media office said. The co-pilot had trained at the Lufthansa flight training center in Bremen Germany.A dangerous searchRelatives and friends of the victims embarked on an emotional trip Thursday: traveling close to the mountainous spot where their loved ones perished.Special Lufthansa flights from Germany and Spain are taking relatives and friends of the victims to southern France. The airline has offered to take them as close to the crash site as possible ""within the safety parameters of the investigation "" Lufthansa said in a statement.They are first expected to stop in the town of Le Vernet for a ""moment of reverence "" Seyne-les-Alpes Mayor Francis Hermitte said.They will then carry on to the village of Seyne-les-Alpes which has become a staging post for the recovery operation. A further ceremony is expected there Hermitte said.He said he anticipated 200 to 300 people would come to the area Thursday not just relatives of the victims but also people close to the families.Most are not expected to stay overnight he said. But in case they do he said local residents have spontaneously offered accommodations for them to stay.While some human remains have been recovered from the crash scene many have not.

(AP)INDIANAPOLIS  The heat over Indiana's new religious objections law spread Friday across social media and to the White House as many local officials and business groups around the state tried to jump in and stem the fallout.Use of the hashtag #boycottindiana spread across Twitter spurred on by activists such as ""Star Trek"" actor George Takei who argued that the measure opens the door to legalized discrimination against gay people. Apple CEO Tim Cook also tweeted his objections saying he was ""deeply disappointed"" in the Indiana law.Supporters of the bill that Republican Gov. Mike Pence signed Thursday say discrimination claims are overblown. They maintain courts haven't allowed that to happen under similar laws covering the federal government and in 19 other states. The measure which takes effect in July prohibits state and local laws that ""substantially burden"" the ability of people including businesses and associations to follow their religious beliefs.Some national gay-rights groups say lawmakers in Indiana and about a dozen other states proposed such bills this year as a way to essentially grant a state-sanctioned waiver for discrimination as the nation's highest court prepares to mull the gay marriage question.White House press secretary Josh Earnest on Friday noted the negative reaction to the Indiana law from many businesses and organizations around the country.""The signing of this bill doesn't seem like it's a step in the direction of equality and justice and liberty for all Americans "" he said.The Arkansas Senate approved a similar proposal Friday despite opposition from home-state retail giant Wal-Mart. Another measure stalled Thursday in the Georgia Legislature after opponents cited the fallout over the Indiana law.Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard a Republican who opposed the law said he and other city officials would be talking to many businesses and convention planners to counter the uproar the law has caused.""I'm more concerned about making sure that everyone knows they can come in here and feel welcome "" Ballard said.Groups such as the Indiana Chamber of Commerce have taken to social media with messages that the state is full of welcoming businesses. Democratic South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg touted on Twitter his city's civil rights ordinance's protections for gays and lesbians while Republican Evansville Mayor Lloyd Winnecke wrote that the law ""sends the wrong message about Indiana.""Stickers touting ""This business serves everyone"" have been appearing on business windows in many Indiana cities.Pence after signing the bill Thursday said opponents had been mischaracterizing the measure and that it was solely a limit on government restricting people's religious liberties.Last year Mississippi enacted a religious objection law just weeks after Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer a Republican vetoed a similar effort there amid criticism from major corporations. Mississippi hasn't had any high-profile instances of the law being used by businesses to deny goods or services to gays.Indiana University law professor Daniel Conkle who testified in favor of the bill in Indiana legislative committees said he was a supporter of gay rights and that the predictions of negative implications from the law were unjustified.Conkle who has written extensively on religious legal issues said he didn't know of any cases under the similar state laws or the federal statute which dates to 1993 where a court had sided with a religious objector in a discrimination case.""This 'license-to-discriminate' argument that seems to have this relentless repetition is just legally wrong "" Conkle said Friday. ""It is as if you just keep repeating something often enough it takes on a life of its own.""Chris Gahl a vice president of Visit Indy said the tourism agency was pointing out to convention planners that cities such as Chicago New Orleans and St. Louis are in states that already have religious objections laws.That's part of protecting city's tourism and convention business which is estimated to have a $4.4 billion annual economic impact with some 75 000 jobs.""We know that their ability to work is largely dependent on our ability to score convention business and draw in events and visitors "" Gahl said.",http://us.cnn.com/2015/03/31/politics/arkansas-religious-freedom-anti-lgbt-bill/index.html,Arkansas poised to adopt religious freedom law,"Washington (CNN)Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson now has to decide if he wants Mike Pence's headache.The Arkansas House on Tuesday approved a religious freedom measure that mirrors the one Pence signed into law in Indiana -- sparking outrage from businesses sports organizations and popular culture figures who said it opened the door to discrimination against gays and lesbians.Hutchinson a Republican in his first year in office said Monday that he'd sign the measure -- but that was when lawmakers were still trying to find tweaks that ultimately eluded them.Zeleny on how Indiana law impacts 2016 GOP hopefuls 01:37PLAY VIDEOREAD: Mike Pence says he wasn't expecting backlash""If this bill reaches my desk in similar form as to what has been passed in 20 other states then I will sign it "" he said then.A Hutchinson spokesman told CNN that the governor will release a public statement announcing what he's decided to do Wednesday morning -- likely around 11:30 a.m. Eastern time. He said there will be no public signing ceremony.The perils Hutchinson faces were made clear Tuesday morning when Pence insisted he'd ""fix"" Indiana's law to make sure it doesn't allow businesses like Christian florists or bakers to turn away gay and lesbian customers -- which the bill's conservative supporters had said was one of their chief goals.""Was I expecting this kind of backlash? Heavens no "" Pence said.Following Indiana Arkansas becomes the second of what could be a spate of states to add religious freedom laws to their books this year. There are 14 other states considering similar proposals this year according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.Advocates of the measures insist they're simply mimicking what the federal government did under President Bill Clinton and what 19 other states had already done.But the context has changed. The Supreme Court is poised to issue a ruling that could legalize same-sex marriage across the United States -- and social conservatives have come to view religious freedom laws as the next frontier in the culture clash over gay rights.And Indiana's fight exposed another problem: Gays and lesbians lack the shield that a state anti-discrimination law that includes protections based on sexual orientation would offer -- and Pence has said he's not interested in changing that.Making social conservatives' case harder is the intense opposition from business communities. In Arkansas home-state giant Walmart was a leading critic of the religious freedom bill.The other states where religious freedom bills have been introduced are Colorado Georgia Hawaii Michigan Montana Nevada North Carolina Oklahoma South Carolina South Dakota Texas Utah West Virginia and Wyoming.Those efforts have stalled though in North Carolina and Georgia.A Georgia bill hit a roadblock when a House member successfully amended anti-discrimination language into it.And in North Carolina Republican Gov. Pat McCrory has said he won't sign the measure into law saying Monday in a radio interview that the proposal ""makes no sense.""""What is the problem they're trying to solve?"" McCrory said.

After the captain knocked on the door to get back into the cockpit the plane began its descent prompting an alarm to sound.Sondheimer never heard a response from Lubitz as the aircraft flew into the ravine.The full transcript has yet to be publicly released the newspaper reports. The black box captures up to two hours of the pilots conversations as well as other cockpit noises.Saturday the Wall Street Journal reported that Lubitzs eye difficulties were serious enough to ground him. Investigators told the paper that the 26-year-old had been examined by an eye specialist and that the appointments appeared to have taken place at University Hospital Dusseldorf.The paper said evidence uncovered during searches of Lubitzs apartment and his parents home indicated he had his eyes examined and was being treated for depression.The Journal said the 27-year-old Lubitz was being seen by a neuropsychologist for depression. The doctor gave Lubitz a note excusing him from the work the day of the crash but he ignored the advice and reported to work the paper said citing its source a person familiar with the investigation.German prosecutors reported Friday that Lubitz shredded the doctors notes for the day of the crash and other days supporting their assessment that Lubitz hid his medical illness from his employer and colleagues. They refused to say if the hidden illness was depression.The Journal said that while Lubitz had sought to conceal his mental illness there was no evidence that the fear of losing his medical classification as being fit to fly triggered his actions though this would be a plausible explanation the person said.His pilot's license is up for renewal in July and would be in jeopardy if he was diagnosed as mentally ill.The person told the Journal there was no evidence Lubitz was taking mind-altering medication that could have affected his judgment in the cockpit.When someone makes the same decision five or six times all leading toward one specific end you have to assume they are acting intentionally the person told the paper alluding to Mr. Lubitzs lack of reaction when urged by the pilot to open the locked cockpit door. Prosecutors said the cockpit voice recorder showed Lubitz breathing normally in the last moments of the flight even as the pilot tried to get back into the cockpit and passengers screamed for their lives.The Journal quoted a Lufthansa spokesman as saying: All we know was that he had a clean background.Dusseldorf prosecutor Christoph Kumpa said Friday the doctor's note for the day of the crash indicated Lubitz ""was declared by a medical doctor unfit to work.""Bild on Friday said Lubitz had been designated as ""not suitable for flying"" by his instructors at Lufthansa's training school in Arizona around the time that he halted his pursuit of a pilot's license in 2009.The tabloid said Lubitz spent 18 months receiving psychiatric treatment was diagnosed with a ""severe depressive episode "" and received what it called a ""special regular medical examination.""Neighbors described a man whose physical health was superb and road race records show Lubitz took part in several long-distance runs.Prosecutors said there was no indication of any political or religious motivation for Lubitz's actions on the Barcelona-Dusseldorf flight.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",http://us.cnn.com/2015/03/30/europe/france-germanwings-plane-crash-what-we-know/index.html,Germanwings plane crash: What we know so far,"(CNN)Details continue to emerge about the final moments of Germanwings Flight 9525 and the life of the co-pilot who authorities say appears to have set it on a fatal trajectory into the French Alps.But the crucial question of why he would choose to crash a plane with 150 people on board remains a daunting puzzle.Search teams are recovering remains from the mountainside where the aircraft went down and investigators in Germany are hunting for clues.Here's the key information that's available so far and the big questions still in need of answers.The co-pilotAttention has focused on the 27-year-old co-pilot Andreas Lubitz since a French prosecutor said last week that he appeared to have locked the pilot out of the cockpit and deliberately crashed the plane.Reports: Anti-depressants found in co-pilot's apartment 01:25PLAY VIDEOVarious news reports have emerged suggesting Lubitz may have been suffering from mental health problems. Antidepressants were reportedly found at his apartment in Dusseldorf Germany.The New York Times has reported that Lubitz sought treatment before the crash for vision problems that might have put his career at risk. The vision problems could have been psychosomatic according to the newspaper.CNN has not been able to confirm these reports and authorities haven't publicly disclosed what was ailing Lubitz.Officials say Lubitz had been hiding an illness from his employer and had been declared unfit to work by a doctor. Authorities said investigators found torn-up medical leave notes including for the day of the crash in Lubitz's apartment. Germanwings said it had never received a sick note from Lubitz.The big questions: What prompted Lubitz's apparent decision to steer the plane down into the mountains? What health problems was Lubitz suffering from and did they play any role in the crash?The final momentsOver the weekend the German newspaper Bild published a summarized transcript of what it claimed was the audio captured by the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder.Germanwings plane crashes in France 30 photosEXPAND GALLERYIt reports more details of what the pilots said than had previously been revealed including Capt. Patrick Sondenheimer banging on the locked cockpit door and screaming ""For God's sake open the door!""Officials haven't officially released the audio from the cockpit voice recorder and CNN cannot independently verify the information that Bild says is based on the 1.5 hours of sound captured by the device.France's accident investigation agency BEA told CNN it was ""dismayed"" by the voice recording leak to Bild. Martine Del Bono a spokeswoman for the agency said the BEA considered the report to be ""voyeurism.""According to Bild's report Sondenheimer told Lubitz that he didn't manage to go to the bathroom before takeoff. Lubitz responded by saying that the captain could go anytime. After Sondenheimer leaves the cockpit the plane starts to descend.Lubitz didn't say anything during the final descent but the recording picks up his steady breathing according to authorities.The big question: What exactly happened inside the cockpit during those last minutes?The investigationOfficials left Lubitz's apartment Friday night with boxes of papers and evidence folders after spending about 90 minutes inside.Investigators have said they still have interviews and other work to do before they can reveal what they gleaned from the records found in the apartment and at Lubitz's parents' home in the town of Montabaur. They are expected to question the co-pilots relatives friends and co-workers.Germanwings questions and answers 01:33PLAY VIDEODusseldorf police said Saturday that a small team of French investigators had arrived in the city and that they were sharing information.Jean Pierre Michel lead investigator for the French inquiry said in Dusseldorf that the French team would work in ""full transparency"" with their German counterparts.Asked by a journalist about reports of Lubitz's possible mental illness he replied: ""The elements of the investigation are strictly confidential and we cannot address these matters today.""Michel said that no scenario could yet be ruled out including mechanical failure because investigators do not have ""the necessary evidence.""Searcher's still haven't found the plane's flight data recorder which stores a vast array of data about the aircraft's performance and could provide investigators with vital information.The big question: What will investigators eventually be able to prove about what happened on board Flight 9525?The airlineGermanwings and its parent company Lufthansa are still reeling from the disaster. Senior managers are facing a barrage of questions about Lubitz and the company's policies.Lubitz passed his annual pilot recertification medical examination in summer 2014 a German aviation source told CNN.Is Lufthansa entirely responsible for Germanwings crash? 02:43PLAY VIDEOAn official with Lufthansa said that the exam only tests physical health not psychological health. If Lubitz had vision problems as reported by The New York Times they would have been discovered during the tests according to the official.The company was never given any indication Lubitz was depressed the official said and if he went to a doctor on his own he would have been required to self-report if he had been deemed unfit to fly.The company has already changed its rules following the crash to ensure that two crew members are in the cockpit at all times. Many other airlines have taken similar steps or been advised by authorities to do so.The big questions: How much liability for the crash will Germanwings and Lufthansa face? Will other changes in airlines' policies come about as a result of the Germanwings crash?The people on boardMore and more information is coming to light about the lives of the passengers and crew members on Flight 9525.Victim's family gathers near crash site 02:47PLAY VIDEOThey include Iranian sports journalists who had been covering a big Spanish soccer game between Barcelona and Real Madrid; a group of students from a German town who were returning from a school trip; two successful German opera singers who had performed at a Barcelona theater; and an American mother and daughter from Virginia.Most of the people on the flight were from Germany or Spain officials have said.Searchers at the mountainside crash site are continuing with their precarious mission to recover the remains of the dead.Relatives of the victims and local residents have gathered for memorial ceremonies near the crash site in recent days.The flightFlight 9525 an Airbus A320 took off at 10:01 a.m. March 24 from Barcelona bound for Dusseldorf.

And that development could risk the ire of Congress which had agreed to hold off on pursuing new sanctions while negotiations were underway. The Associated Press reports that according to officials the U.S. Iran and five world powers are preparing to issue a general statement on Tuesday agreeing to continue talks in a new phase aimed at reaching a final agreement to control Iran's nuclear ambitions by the end of June. Originally international negotiators were working against a Tuesday at midnight (6 p.m. Eastern Time) deadline to reach the framework for a deal. But the negotiators later softened that so they were aiming for a mere framework understanding between Iran and the so-called P5+1 nations -- the United States Britain France Germany Russia and China. After intense negotiations obstacles remained on uranium enrichment where stockpiles of enriched uranium should be stored limits on Iran's nuclear research and development and the timing and scope of sanctions relief among other issues. The joint statement is to be accompanied by additional documents that outline more detailed understandings allowing the sides to claim enough progress has been made thus far to merit a new round the officials told the AP. Iran has not yet signed off on the documents one official said meaning any understanding remains unclear. Without a clear framework however the Obama administration could face rising pressure from Capitol Hill -- which in turn could create turbulence in the talks themselves. The talks have already been extended twice as part of more than a decade of diplomatic attempts to curb Tehran's nuclear advance. The softening of the language from a framework ""agreement"" to a framework ""understanding"" appeared due in part to opposition to a two-stage agreement from Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Earlier this year he demanded only one deal that nails down specifics and does not permit the other side to ""make things difficult"" by giving it wiggle room on interpretations. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has been meeting with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif in the Swiss town of Lausanne since Thursday in an intense effort to reach a political understanding on the issue. Kerry and others at the table said the sides have made some progress with Iran considering demands for further cuts to its uranium enrichment program but pushing back on how long it must limit technology it could use to make atomic arms. In addition to sticking points on research and development differences remain on the timing and scope of sanctions removal officials told the Associated Press. Adding another layer of complexity to the difficult negotiations The Wall Street Journal citing Western officials reported late Monday that there are signs that Khamenei has not granted his negotiators the power to budge from their positions on certain critical issues. In particular the Journal reported that Khamenei has repeatedly insisted that U.N. sanctions be lifted immediately once any deal takes effect. By contrast the U.S. and the other nations involved have proposed that sanctions would only be lifted gradually and be tied to Iran living up to promises it has made in any agreement. German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Monday that Iran's expectations from the talks are ""very ambitious"" and not yet acceptable to his country or the other five negotiating. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov left the talks on Monday and planned to return only if the prospects for a deal looked good. The Obama administration says any deal will stretch the time Iran needs to make a nuclear weapon from the present two to three months to at least a year. But critics object that it would keep Tehran's nuclear technology intact. Tehran has said it is willing to address concerns about its stockpiles of enriched uranium although it has denied that will involve shipping it out of the country as some Western officials have said. One official said on Monday that Iran might deal with the issue by diluting its stocks to a level that would not be weapons grade. Over the past weeks Iran has moved from demanding that it be allowed to keep nearly 10 000 centrifuges enriching uranium to agreeing to 6 000. The officials said Tehran now may be ready to accept even fewer.

Negotiations resumed in Switzerland on Wednesday but were almost immediately beset by competing claims just hours after diplomats abandoned a March 31 deadline to reach the outline of a deal and agreed to press on. And as the latest round hit the week mark three of the six foreign ministers involved left the talks with prospects for agreement remaining uncertain. Amid the confusion Sen. Tom Cotton R-Ark. told Fox News he's concerned the framework of a deal could allow Iran keep its uranium stockpiles and continue to enrich uranium in an underground bunker. ""You have to be willing to walk away from the table and to reapply leverage to Iran "" Cotton said. ""And the fact that they're not willing to do that that we're still sitting in Switzerland negotiating when three of our negotiating partners have already left just demonstrates to Iran that they can continue to demand dangerous concessions from the West."" Speaking on MSNBC former Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean seemed to agree. He said that while President Obama is ""right"" to seek a deal it might be time to ""step away"" from the table and make clear that the U.S. is not backing off key positions -- including on Iran's uranium stockpile and the pace of sanctions relief. More on this...Iran backs away from uranium concession ahead of deadline""I am worried about this "" Dean said. Rep. Martha McSally R-Ariz. also told Fox News ""we're potentially [legitimizing] them having a nuclear infrastructure."" She added: ""We don't know exactly what's behind closed doors."" Despite all sides agreeing to blow by their deadline in pursuit of a rough agreement even the White House threatened to abandon the talks if Iran wouldn't budge. ""If they're unwilling to make those kinds of commitments that give us that assurance and by us I mean not just the United States. I mean the international community then we'll have to walk away from the negotiating table and consider what other options may be available to us and there is certainly the possibility that that could happen "" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday. On Tuesday negotiators had been trying to agree to simply a joint statement that could justify talks continuing until a final June deadline. Iran's deputy foreign minister Abbas Araghchi told reporters that if the sides make progress on the text of a joint statement then that could be issued by the end of the day. But he suggested the statement would contain no specifics. A senior western official quickly pushed back saying that nothing about a statement had been decided and that Iran's negotiating partners would not accept a document that contained no details. The German Foreign Ministry tweeted that ""nothing is agreed "" although ""progress is visible."" Araghchi named differences on sanctions relief on his country as one dispute along with disputes on Iran's uranium enrichment-related research and development. ""Definitely our research and development program on high-end centrifuges should continue "" he told Iranian television. The U.S. and its negotiating partners want to crimp Iranian efforts to improve the performance of centrifuges that enrich uranium because advancing the technology could let Iran produce material that could be used to arm a nuclear weapon much more quickly than at present. The exchanges reflected significant gaps between the sides and came shortly after the end of the first post-deadline meeting between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry his British and German counterparts and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif in the Swiss town of Lausanne. They and their teams were continuing a marathon effort to bridge still significant gaps and hammer out a framework accord that would serve as the basis for a final agreement by the end of June. Eager to avoid a collapse in the discussions the United States and others claimed late Tuesday that enough progress had been made to warrant an extension after six days of intense bartering. But the foreign ministers of China France and Russia all departed Lausanne overnight although the significance of their absence was not clear. Kerry postponed his planned Tuesday departure to stay in Lausanne and an Iranian negotiator said his team would stay ""as long as necessary"" to clear the remaining hurdles. Officials say their intention is to produce a joint statement outlining general political commitments to resolving concerns about Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. In addition they are trying to fashion other documents that would lay out in more detail the steps they must take by June 30 to meet those goals. The additional documents would allow the sides to make the case that the next round of talks will not simply be a continuation of negotiations that have already been twice extended since an interim agreement between Iran the United States Russia China Britain France and Germany was concluded in November 2013. Obama and other leaders including Iran's have said they are not interested in a third extension. But if the parties agree only to a broad framework that leaves key details unresolved Obama can expect stiff opposition at home from members of Congress who want to move forward with new stiffer Iran sanctions. Lawmakers had agreed to hold off on such a measure through March while the parties negotiated. The White House says new sanctions would scuttle further diplomatic efforts to contain Iran's nuclear work and possibly lead Israel to act on threats to use military force to accomplish that goal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continued to question the course of talks on Wednesday. He said Iran views Israel's destruction as non-negotiable ""but evidently giving Iran's murderous regime a clear path to the bomb is negotiable. This is unconscionable "" he said. ""At the same time Iran is accelerating its campaign of terror subjugation and conquest throughout the region most recently in Yemen."" Netanyahu said a better deal would ""significantly roll back Iran's nuclear infrastructure"" and link a lifting of restrictions on its nuclear program to ""a change in Iran's behavior.""

The talks were supposed to wrap up Tuesday but have been extended two days and counting.Addressing reporters Thursday morning in Lausanne Switzerland Zarif said that ""we have made significant progress (but) we don't have a final result yet."" He added that the parties expect to set the parameters for what will be part of a comprehensive agreement which faces a June 30 deadline.Later as he was walking back to the hotel where the negotiations were being held he told reporters that a media statement on the talks might be released.Issuing a statement sounds like something less significant than the framework of understanding that the parties were aiming for.""What we expect today is a statement and the fact that we have all reached common understanding on how to resolve the issues "" Zarif said. ""But the agreement a written agreement is something that needs to be drafted by all participants and agreed upon in a multilateral process. And that would take hopefully three months to finalize and hopefully less.""Asked if an understanding has been reached on all issues Zarif replied ""that's what we think we have but nothing is agreed until everything is agreed.""World powers -- the United States Russia China France the United Kingdom and Germany -- were examining the results of the overnight talks without Iran present he said.The talks aimed at reaching a preliminary political deal on Iran's nuclear program blew past their initial self-imposed deadline of late Tuesday as Iranian and U.S. negotiators struggled to find compromises on key issues.But the negotiators have doggedly continued their work in Lausanne trying to overcome decades of mistrust between Tehran and Washington.The mutual mistrust has been a serious problem in the talks Zarif said.""I believe respect is something that needs to be exercised in practice and in deeds and I hope that everyone is engaging in that in mutual respect "" he said.'A few meters from the finishing line'""We are a few meters from the finishing line but it's always the last meters that are the most difficult. We will try and cross them "" French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said as he returned to the talks late Wednesday. ""We want a robust and verifiable agreement and there are still points where there needs to be progress especially on the Iranian side.""Iran wants swift relief from punishing sanctions that have throttled its economy. And Western countries want to make sure any deal holds Iran back from being able to rapidly develop a nuclear weapon.It's unclear what kind of accord might emerge from this round of talks -- Iran appears to be resisting too many specifics while the U.S. side wants to put hard numbers on key points.Whatever it might turn out to be the interim deal will need to be fleshed out into a full deal by June 30. Some of the thorniest issues could end up being left for that final phase.But in the meantime the Obama administration needs something solid enough it can sell to a skeptical Congress which has threatened to impose new sanctions on Iran. The potential deal is also coming under sustained attack from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.21 questions on Iranian nuclear talks",58,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/04/02/garissa-attack-kenya/,Al-Shabaab 'holding many Christians alive' amid attack on Kenyan university,"Al-Shabaab gunmen attack Kenyan collegeNever autoplay videosAl-Shabaab says they are ""holding many Christians alive"" after claiming responsibility for an attack at Garissa University in eastern Kenya Thursday that left at least 15 people dead dozens more injured and hundreds of students unaccounted for.Kenya's security forces are now trying to dislodge the gunmen from at least one dorm at the university.""There are many dead bodies of Christians inside the building "" Al-Shabaab spokesman Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab told Sky News.

And on the heels of a framework deal being announced in Switzerland France's top diplomat on Friday admitted his country had initially held out for firmer terms. The emerging reports indicate the U.S. team led by Secretary of State John Kerry gradually backed down over the course of the talks as Iran's delegation dug in. The Wall Street Journal citing current and former U.S. representatives at the discussions claimed the White House had initially hoped to persuade Iran to dismantle much of the country's nuclear infrastructure when talks started in late 2013 only to be told categorically that Iran would not do so. The Journal reported that one Iranian diplomat called the nuclear program ""our moon shot "" comparing it to the U.S. space program in the 1960s as a symbol of national pride and advancement. From that point the Journal reports the U.S. accepted that any possible deal would likely enable Iran to continue to enrich some uranium to produce nuclear fuel and turned their focus to extending Iran's so-called ""breakout time"" or the minimum period that Iran would need to build a nuclear weapon. The framework of an agreement was announced Thursday after marathon talks in Switzerland that stretched two days past their original deadline. The plan containing dozens of provisions would effectively require Iran to wind down or suspend parts of its nuclear program that could be used for nuclear weapon development in exchange for sweeping sanctions relief. The preliminary agreement allows all sides -- the U.S. Iran and five other world powers -- to continue working toward a final deal by a June 30 deadline.More on this...Will agreement with Iran pave way to a nuclear bomb?However not all of the Western powers appeared completely pleased with the agreement. On Friday French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told Europe 1 radio that France had rejected an original of the deal outline as ""not solid enough"" and had held out for firmer conditions. However Fabius told the radio station that the Iranian delegation had responded by threatening to walk out of the talks. The French delegation was considered by observers to be one of the hardest bargainers of the P5+1 countries a group which also included the U.S. Britain Germany Russia and China. Fabius told Europe 1 that France wants a firm deal ""to prevent other countries in the Gulf such as Saudi Arabia from embarking on nuclear proliferation.""As for the framework itself Fabius called it a ""very important"" step but noted that ""the end of the road is the end of June.""According to the Journal U.S. scientists concluded that a year was enough time for the West to detect any move by Iran to build a nuclear bomb and execute a response. As part of keeping Iran at the table the paper reports the U.S. made more concessions to Tehran. Some of which reportedly angered their negotiating partners most notably the French. What resulted according to a fact sheet released by negotiators Thursday was an agreement that called for Iran to reduce the number of its centrifuges from 19 000 to around 6 100 with most enriching uranium for 10 years. Iran also agreed not to enrich uranium at its contentious Fordo facility for at least 15 years and would not build any new facilities for enrichment for the same time period. The framework would allow international inspectors to have ""regular access"" to nuclear sites. In exchange U.S. and European Union sanctions would be suspended after inspectors verify Iran ""has taken all of its key nuclear-related steps.""

The national focus on whether new religious objections laws in Indiana and Arkansas could be used to discriminate against gays and lesbians has boosted efforts for broader civil rights law protections in those and other states. (AP Photo/Doug McSchooler File) (The Associated Press)INDIANAPOLIS  Gay rights advocates are hoping to parlay the momentum from their legislative victories in Indiana and Arkansas this week into further expanding legal protections for gays and lesbians in those states and others.Facing widespread pressure including from big businesses such as Apple and Wal-Mart lawmakers in Indiana and Arkansas rolled back their states' new religious objections laws which critics said could be used to discriminate against gays. Amid the uproar the Republican governors of Michigan and South Dakota urged their own legislatures to extend anti-discrimination protections to gays.Twenty-nine states currently don't include protections for gays and lesbians in their non-discrimination laws according to the American Civil Liberties Union. But the Indiana and Arkansas laws along with court rulings or legislatures legalizing same-sex marriage in 37 states and an expected U.S. Supreme Court decision on gay marriage this year are fueling efforts to change that as the 2016 elections approach.""We're not going to let any of these people off the hot seat "" said Kathy Sarris co-founder of the gay-rights group Indiana Equality Action. ""This ultimately is going to happen in Indiana.""Most of the states without sexual orientation protections are in the South or the Plains which tend to be more conservative. As public opinion has become more supportive of same-sex marriage and other gay rights in recent years many businesses say such protections factor into their decisions about expansions and help them attract top employees.Arkansas state Rep. Warwick Sabin a Democrat from Little Rock said the issue isn't going away.""Other states are moving ahead of us and Arkansas is being left in the dust. We need to make an affirmative statement about our values as a state and I know that the vast majority of Arkansans believe in fairness and opportunity for all of its citizens "" he said.Indiana's Republican-controlled Legislature took a first step by adding language to its new religious objections law stating that service providers can't use the law as a legal defense for refusing to provide goods services facilities or accommodations based on sexual orientation gender identity and other factors. It is now the first Indiana state law that explicitly mentions sexual orientation and gender identity.Arkansas' amended law only addresses actions by the government not by businesses or individuals. The law's supporters say the changes would prevent businesses from using it to deny services to individuals even though it doesn't include specific anti-discrimination language similar to Indiana's law.Gay rights proponents want Arkansas to go further though and are trying to build support for adding sexual orientation to the protected statuses covered by the state's civil rights laws. The state's attorney general Leslie Rutledge last week approved the wording of a proposed ballot measure that would add such protections clearing the way for supporters to begin gathering the signatures needed to get it on the November 2016 ballot.""Today LGBT Arkansans are still unequal and today's battle points toward a broader struggle ahead a fight where full and complete equality for all Arkansans that cannot be undermined is the only acceptable outcome "" Chad Griffin president of the Human Rights Campaign the nation's largest LGBT rights group said in a statement after Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson signed that state's law.Hutchinson meanwhile has left open the possibility of issuing an executive order that would prohibit workplace discrimination against lesbian gay bisexual and transgender people at state agencies.Similar debates are going on elsewhere. In North Dakota on Thursday the Republican-controlled Legislature voted down a measure that would have prohibited discrimination based on a person's sexual orientation in the areas of housing and employment. Gov. Jack Dalrymple rebuked lawmakers saying such discrimination wasn't acceptable.In Michigan meanwhile GOP Gov. Rick Snyder warned legislators that he would veto a religious objections bill unless they also sent him a measure that would extend anti-discrimination protections to gays. He cited the Indiana outcry in making his warning.Indiana Gov. Mike Pence and fellow Republicans maintained that the state's religious objections law never sanctioned discrimination against anyone. They said considering changes to the state's civil rights law was too major of a policy change to take up with less than a month left in the legislative session.State Senate President David Long acknowledged ""it's probably likely"" that extending anti-discrimination laws to cover sexual orientation will be on next year's agenda.""You can see that this discussion has been elevated in Indiana and it's an important one "" Long said.Some gay-rights supporters say the push for religious freedom laws proposed in about a dozen states this year amounts to a consolation prize for conservatives dismayed over the legalization of same-sex marriages across much of the country.Some conservative activists have a different take.Eric Miller the executive director of an Indiana group Advance America called the national outcry over the state's law an ""orchestrated effort of misinformation"" led by those pushing for ""government recognition government approval adding to our civil-rights laws protections for sexual orientation and gender identity.""__DeMillo reported from Little Rock Arkansas.",http://us.cnn.com/2015/03/27/politics/indiana-religous-freedom-explainer/index.html,Indiana's religious freedom law: What you need to know,"(CNN)Indiana Gov. Mike Pence stirred up controversy this week when he signed a ""religious freedom"" bill into law.The law has businesses and civil rights groups up in arms and threatening -- or in some cases pledging -- to boycott the state.The reaction has gotten so hot that on Saturday Pence told The Indianapolis Star that he is working with legislators to amend the law and ""clarify"" that it does not promote discrimination.He told the Star that a new bill would likely be introduced in coming days but did not specify what it would say or who would introduce it.What's so controversial about religious freedom?It's not so much that religious freedom has suddenly become controversial but rather critics of the bill assert the law could be used by individuals and businesses to discriminate on the basis of religion -- particularly against the LGBT community of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender individuals.That's a claim Pence has thoroughly rejected: ""This bill is not about discrimination. And if I thought it was about discrimination I would have vetoed it.""But civil liberties and gay rights groups assert that the law could be used by businesses to deny service to people based on their sexual orientation and justify that discrimination based on their religious belief.The law asserts that the government can't ""substantially burden a person's exercise of religion"" and that individuals who feel like their religious beliefs have been or could be ""substantially burdened"" can lean on this law to fend off lawsuits.So what qualifies as a substantial burden?Well that's not entirely clear and would likely have to be litigated in the courts if cases involving this law come up.Supporters of these laws bring up the example of a florist who refuses to sell flowers for a gay wedding or a baker who won't make that couple's wedding cake -- and it's clear this law is aimed at fending off lawsuits that florist and that baker might face.But what about a restaurant that refuses to serve a gay couple simply wanting to sit down for a meal?""It would foil any lawsuit against a supplier who acted on religious grounds but the law can get squirrely "" CNN Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin said adding that it's likely that a refusal to serve a gay person wouldn't stand under the law but a refusal to provide a service for a gay wedding would.Is Indiana the first state to implement this kind of a law?Nope. It's actually the 20th state to adopt a ""religious freedom restoration"" law most of which are modeled after the Religious Freedom Restoration Act which President Bill Clinton signed into law in 1993.But that law passed with the backing of a broad-based coalition and wasn't set against the backdrop of gay rights or the wave of marriage equality laws that have swept the country in recent years.The law in Indiana though as well as the slew of other states it follows came after an outcry from social conservative circles over incidents where business owners found themselves in hot water after refusing services to gay couples planning to get married.In addition to those 20 states legislators in nine other states have introduced similar types of ""religious freedom"" laws -- bills that either failed to go through in 2014 or are still up for consideration this year.But Adam Talbot a spokesman with the Human Rights Campaign a gay rights group stressed that those 20 laws are ""dramatically different in their scope and effect.""""Calling them similar in this way risks being misleading. Indiana is the broadest and most dangerous law of its kind in the country "" Talbot said.Arkansas' legislature passed an Indiana-style law on Friday which now heads to the state's governor for approval.Religious liberty -- and using it to push back against same-sex marriage and other gay rights -- has become the rallying cry for the social conservative movement in the last year as these groups have watched one anti-gay marriage law after the next tumble in the courts.And standing behind with Pence as he signed the bill were several socially conservative lobbyists the ones who pushed for the law and are fiercely opposed to same-sex marriage.One of those lobbyists Eric Miller explicitly wrote on his website that the law would protect businesses from participating in ""homosexual marriage.""""The only reason these laws have passed is because of same sex marriage. Everybody knows that "" Toobin said. The political calculation that states are going to have to make is is the reward from the religious groups greater than the cost in lost business.""Have these ""religious freedom restoration"" laws already been used as legal defenses?Yup. The Human Rights Campaign pointed CNN to several cases in which individuals have used these laws in court -- and not just in cases involving LGBT people and weddings.A police officer in Oklahoma claimed a religious objection when he refused to police a mosque. A police officer in Salt Lake City cited his ""religious liberty"" when he refused to police a gay pride parade.A photographer in New Mexico used religious freedom as a defense for not serving a lesbian couple in 2013.Are there any protections against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation?Yes 21 states currently have laws on the books prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. And another 9 have those protections but just for public employees.Angie's List halts Indiana expansion over law",62,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/04/23/american-warren-weinstein-who-was-killed-in-pakistan-was-working-on-business/,American Warren Weinstein  who was killed in Pakistan  was working on business development,"FILE - This image made from video released anonymously to reporters in Pakistan on Thursday Dec. 26 2013 which is consistent with other AP reporting shows Warren Weinstein a 72-year-old American development worker who was kidnapped in Pakistan by al-Qaida in 2011.

(AP)GARISSA Kenya  The son of a Kenyan government official has been identified as one of the gunmen who attacked a Kenyan college where 148 people were killed authorities said Sunday.Abdirahim Mohammed Abdullahi one of the Islamic extremists who attacked Garissa University College was the son of a government chief in Mandera County Interior Ministry spokesman Mwenda Njoka told The Associated Press.The chief had reported his son missing last year and said he feared that he had gone to Somalia said Njoka. All four attackers were killed by Kenyan security forces on Thursday said police.Abdullahi graduated from the University of Nairobi with a law degree in 2013 and was viewed as a ""brilliant upcoming lawyer "" according to someone who knew him. It is not clear where he worked before he disappeared last year Njoka said.To prevent an escalation of Islamic radicalization in Kenya it is important that parents inform authorities if their children go missing or show tendencies of following violent extremism said Njoka.Somalia's al-Shabaab Islamic militants claimed responsibility for the attack on Garissa college Thursday saying it is retribution for Kenya deploying troops to Somalia to fight the extremist rebels.The news that one of the attackers was Kenyan came as grieving Christians prayed sang and clapped hands at an Easter Sunday service at a Catholic church in Garissa.Security forces patrolled the perimeter of Our Lady of Consolation Church which was attacked by militants almost three years ago. Grenades lobbed at the building sprayed shrapnel into the interior injuring some worshippers. Another Garissa church was also attacked that day and 17 people were killed.Sunday's ceremony was laden with emotion for the several hundred members of Garissa's Christian minority which is fearful following the attack by al-Shabaab a Somalia-based Islamic extremist group. The gunmen who attacked Garissa University College on Thursday singled out Christians for killing though al-Shabaab has a long record of killing Muslims over the years.""We just keep on praying that God can help us to comfort us in this difficult time "" said Dominick Odhiambo a worshipper who said he planned to abandon his job as a plumber in Garissa and leave for his hometown because he was afraid.""Thank you for coming so many of you "" Bishop Joseph Alessandro said to the congregation. He said some of those who died in Thursday's attack would have been at the service and he read condolence messages from around the world.Alessandro saw a parallel between the ordeal of Jesus Christ which Easter commemorates and that of Garissa.""We join the sufferings of the relatives and the victims with the sufferings of Jesus "" he said. ""The victims will rise again with Christ.""Alessandro who is from Malta first came to Garissa in 1989 and was shot and injured by bandits on a trip outside the town several years later. He said there had been development in recent years in the area as well as an increase in insecurity because of al-Shabaab.""You don't know who they are. They could be your neighbors "" he said. A heavy security presence only helps up to a point and more intelligence on the militants is needed he said.The church service was spirited combining incense candles and other traditions with local upbeat singing styles. Worshippers swayed to the rhythm of the hymns in the simple structure with latticed walls that let light and a breeze through rectangular openings. Fans mounted above images of the stations of the cross helped to cool the crowd. Birds chirped from the upper reaches of the high ceiling which consists of metal sheeting.Roseline Oduor said she is worried because the church had been attacked in the past.""Having courage as a Christian we just have that faith with coming to church "" Oduor said. ""We have gone through what Jesus went through.""She said: ""When the day comes you cannot run away from death whether under a tree in bed anywhere.""The Islamic militants said the attack on Garissa college was in retaliation for killings carried out by Kenyan troops fighting the rebels in Somalia.""No amount of precaution or safety measures will be able to guarantee your safety thwart another attack or prevent another bloodbath "" said al-Shabaab.Following the extremists' threats Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta vowed to take harsh measures against the Islamic militants.In a nationally televised address Kenyatta said his administration ""shall respond in the severest ways possible"" to the Garissa attack in which four gunmen entered the campus and slaughtered students. The military moved in hours later and the gunmen were killed.""We will fight terrorism to the end "" said Kenyatta. ""I guarantee that my administration shall respond in the fiercest way possible.""Kenyatta said the country's ""security forces are pursuing the remaining accomplices. We will bring all of them to justice ...

Instead lawmakers there are on on the verge of enacting protections based on sexual orientation for the first time in state history.Top Indiana Republican lawmakers are poised to overhaul their week-old religious freedom law Thursday in an effort to ease concerns driven by businesses that it could lead to discrimination.They appear to have tamped down some of the criticism -- but in doing so they've infuriated social conservative activists and they've set the stage for a bigger fight next year over expanding Indiana's anti-discrimination law to cover gays and lesbians.Republican legislative leaders unveiled a series of changes Thursday morning to the law that triggered intense backlash from businesses sports associations pro-LGBT groups and even fiscally-focused conservatives when Gov. Mike Pence signed it last week.The GOP-dominated House and Senate are set to vote on the legislative fix which was added into an unrelated bill on Thursday sending it to Pence's desk almost immediately.The changes would prohibit businesses from using the law as a defense in court for refusing ""to offer or provide services facilities use of public accommodations goods employment or housing"" to any customers based on ""race color religion ancestry age national origin disability sex sexual orientation gender identity or United States military service.""It doesn't accomplish what the law's critics wanted most: Adding sexual orientation to the list of categories protected by Indiana's anti-discrimination law.But that debate GOP legislators acknowledged is coming soon. House Speaker Brian Bosma said the backlash against the religious freedom law has ""opened many perspectives"" and that the anti-discrimination law ""needs to be discussed.""The religious freedom debate has touched a particularly raw nerve in Indiana where a GOP push to amend the state constitution to prohibit same-sex marriage and civil unions was defeated last year -- exposing tensions within Republican caucuses that already have more than two-thirds super majorities in both the Indiana House and Senate.Several Indiana cities already have anti-discrimination laws that include sexual orientation but the legislative fix to the religious freedom law will be the first time protections based on sexual orientation or gender identity are recognized statewide.RELATED: Is the GOP losing Walmart?Social conservatives lambasted lawmakers for walking away from what they saw as a crucial protection for Christian businesses that did not want to provide services to gays and lesbians -- particularly for same-sex weddings.Eric Miller the head of Advance America and a powerful lobbyist who stood behind Pence at last week's private bill signing ceremony said on his website: ""Among the things that will happen Christian bakers florists and photographers would now be forced by the government to participate in a homosexual wedding or else they would be punished by the government! That's not right!""Nationally social conservatives expressed similar objections. Russell Moore the president of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission tweeted: ""This Indiana ""compromise"" is a train wreck. It should be voted down.""Still lawmakers said they had to do something.""What was intended as a message of inclusion was interpreted as a message of exclusion especially for the LGBT community "" Bosma said Thursday morning. ""Nothing could have been further from the truth but it was clear the perception had to be addressed.""The Indiana law and a similar bill that Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson has asked lawmakers there to change had drawn criticism from major companies like Apple Walmart and Salesforce as well as sports associations like the NCAA NBA and NFL.Katie Blair the head of Freedom Indiana a group that lobbies against anti-LGBT measures and is funded by several of Indiana's largest businesses said the changes announced Thursday ""represent a step in the right direction.""""Today the harm has been lessened but we have not reached the day when LGBT Hoosiers can be assured that they can live their lives with freedom from discrimination "" Blair said.Even as they moved to fix the law they'd passed though Indiana Republicans maintained that nothing had really been wrong with it in the first place.""It was misinterpreted "" Bosma said.

(AP Photo/Jane Flavell Collins File) (The Associated Press)BOSTON  With one last chance to connect with the jury lawyers for Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev are expected to continue to portray him as an aimless college student who fell under the domineering influence of his radicalized older brother.But prosecutors are sure to remind the jury of the brutality of the attack the people who were maimed or killed and the image of Tsarnaev standing behind 8-year-old Martin Richard and his family about a minute before the blasts. The boy was one of three people killed when Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan placed two pressure-cooker bombs near the marathon finish line on April 15 2013.Closing arguments in the guilt phase of the trial are scheduled for Monday.Tsarnaev's lawyer admitted he participated in the bombings during her opening statement to the jury. ""It was him "" said attorney Judy Clarke a renowned death penalty lawyer.But Clarke told the jury that it was Tamerlan Tsarnaev who was the mastermind of the attack. Clarke said the 26-year-old had become increasingly radicalized and enlisted Dzhokhar then 19 to help him in an attack meant to retaliate against the U.S. for its actions in Muslim countries.Legal analysts said they expect the defense to stick with a strategy of conceding guilt but trying to persuade the jury that because Tsarnaev was not the driving force behind the attack they should spare him from the death penalty and instead sentence him to life in prison during the second phase of the trial. The same jury will be asked to decide his punishment.During the trial the defense used its four witnesses to show that Tamerlan Tsarnaev had searched for bomb components on his computer while Dzhokhar's computer activity focused largely on Facebook a Russian version of Facebook and other social media sites. The defense also called an FBI fingerprint investigator who said Tamerlan's fingerprints were found on some of the bomb parts recovered at the scene of the marathon bombing while Dzhokhar's were not.""They will continue to downplay his role and play up the role of his older brother trying to create the impression that his older brother was the puppeteer and he was the puppet "" said Christopher Dearborn a professor at Suffolk University Law School.""I don't think they have any hope of prevailing in the guilt phase but their strategy will continue to be to gain some credibility with the jury by conceding what they had to concede and hoping to try to humanize the kid a little bit so that will carry over into the second phase of the trial "" he said.Prosecutors told the jury that Tsarnaev and his brother were partners in the attack. They called witnesses who described how he joined his brother at a New Hampshire firing range to practice shooting about a month before the marathon had fireworks that had been emptied of their explosive powder in his dorm room and scrawled a message inside the boat he was captured in denouncing the U.S. for its wars in Muslim countries.They also called survivors of the bombing who gave heart-wrenching testimony about having legs blown off in the explosions.""I think the prosecution will remind the jury how horrendous this event was and they will further remind the jury that this fellow was a terrorist "" said Boston College Law School professor Robert Bloom.To rebut the defense claim that Dzhokhar was merely a follower of his brother prosecutors also will likely remind the jury that he is shown in surveillance video and still photos carrying a backpack and then with the backpack at his feet on the sidewalk behind the Richard family as well as other children.""The prosecution might say something to the effect of `He didn't do as much as his brother but he did plenty ""' Bloom said.",http://us.cnn.com/2015/04/07/us/boston-marathon-bombing-trial/index.html,Boston bombing trial: Jurors begin deliberations,"Story highlightsJurors began deliberations Tuesday morningIf Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is found guilty of at least one capital count trial will go to penalty phaseProsecutor in closing argument: Tsarnaev ""wanted to awake the mujahedeen the holy warriors""Boston (CNN)After weeks of dramatic and emotionally wrenching testimony jurors began deliberations Tuesday in the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.The 21-year-old accused Boston Marathon bomber faces life in prison or the death penalty.On Monday the jury saw a video of the moment a bomb exploded and disemboweled an 8-year-old boy and ripped the leg off his sister.

Lawyers in the murder trial of former New England Patriots star tight end Aaron Hernandez are set to deliver closing arguments to the jury after a trial that has lasted more than two months and featured testimony from 135 witnesses and hundreds of pieces of evidence.Hernandez is accused in the June 17 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiancee. Lloyd was shot six times and died in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's home. At the time Hernandez had a $40 million contract with the Patriots.Both sides have 90 minutes on Tuesday to make their case to the jury. Hernandez's lawyer will go first followed by the prosecution.Prosecutors said Hernandez and two friends drove to Boston to pick up Lloyd at his home then drove him to the industrial park in North Attleborough and killed him. Surveillance video along the way showed Hernandez driving a rented silver Nissan Altima shortly before Lloyd's sister saw him get into a silver car. Soon after a toll booth camera caught the Nissan leaving Boston. Lloyd's phone pinged several cell towers before stopping in North Attleborough for good.Surveillance video at Hernandez's home minutes after the shooting showed him holding a black item that appeared to be a gun. A joint found near Lloyd's body had Hernandez's and Lloyd's DNA on it.But the defense has said the two men were friends and Hernandez would not have killed him. Prosecutors never presented a motive to jurors. The defense team has also gone after what it called sloppy police work.After closing arguments the judge will give the 15 members of the jury instructions. Three of the jurors will then be randomly selected as alternates. The 12-person jury will then be sent to deliberate. That is expected to happen Tuesday afternoon.,http://us.cnn.com/2015/04/06/us/aaron-hernandez-trial/index.html,Aaron Hernandez trial: Defense rests,"Story highlightsClosing arguments in the case are set for TuesdayAaron Hernandez is charged with first-degree murder in the killing of Odin LloydHis defense lawyers made their case on MondayWatch ""Downward Spiral: Inside the Case against Aaron Hernandez"" at 9 p.m. ET Tuesday.(CNN)It took prosecutors months to present 131 witnesses to support their claim that former NFL star Aaron Hernandez killed semi-pro player Odin Lloyd.On Monday Hernandez's defense gave its side of the story wrapping up its witnesses in less than a day.Hernandez 25 is on trial for the shooting death of Lloyd whose body was found in a Massachusetts industrial park in June 2013.Now that the defense has rested it won't be long before the jury begins deliberating. Much of the evidence in the former New England Patriots' case is circumstantial.Here are some key points jurors will have to consider after each side makes closing arguments on Tuesday:The Patriots owner's testimonyAs news spread that Hernandez was under investigation in June 2013 Patriots owner Robert Kraft called in the tight end for a meeting two days after Lloyd's death.Patriots owner: Aaron Hernandez said he was innocent 03:22PLAY VIDEO""He said he was not involved "" Kraft testified last week. ""He said he was innocent and that he hoped that the time of the murder incident came out because he said he was in a club.""There's only one potential problem with that claim: The time Lloyd was killed hadn't been made public yet by the time Hernandez met with Kraft. So how could Hernandez have known when Lloyd was killed?""What a great great witness for the prosecution "" CNN legal analyst Mel Robbins said. ""Basically what happened is Aaron Hernandez lied to his boss. And the only way you rebut it is if you put him on the stand.""When questioned by a defense attorney Kraft said that he'd never had any problems with Hernandez and that the player was always respectful to him.The fiancee's testimonyHernandez's fiancee Shayanna Jenkins revealed for the first time last week that Hernandez told her to dispose of a box from the couple's home that she said reeked of marijuana. She also said she didn't know what was in the box.Aaron Hernandez's fiance takes the stand 03:16PLAY VIDEOThat revelation may contradict the prosecution's contention that the weapon used in the killing was in the box. The murder weapon in the case has not been recovered.During cross-examination by the defense Jenkins testified that she suspected marijuana because the box smelled ""skunky.""Earlier she told prosecutors during direct examination that she didn't know what was in the box. She said Hernandez never told her and she never looked.After concealing the box with her daughter's clothing Jenkins said she threw it away in ""a random dumpster"" but could not remember exactly where.The pair of Air JordansMuch testimony has focused on the shoes Hernandez wore the night Lloyd was shot.A Nike consultant testified that Hernandez was wearing Nike Air Jordan Retro 11 Lows. About 93 000 pairs of that shoe were made significantly fewer in a size 13. The shoe's sole makes a distinct impression said Lt. Steven Bennett of the Massachusetts State Police.Do Hernandez's dance moves suggest a motive? 03:39PLAY VIDEOThe consultant testified under questioning from defense attorney Jamie Sultan that other Nike shoes -- more than 3 million -- make the same impression.Yet Bennett who works in crime scene services testified that the footprint left near Lloyd's body was ""in agreement"" or consistent with the Air Jordan Retro 11 Lows size 13.Although he did not have the shoes that Hernandez wore that night he used an identical pair to make his determination. Bennett did so by creating a transparency of the sole and laying it over a photo of the footwear impression. Jurors watched as he drew lines showing how the sole aligned with the impression.What may have been a key moment for the prosecution was quickly derailed by defense attorney Jamie Sultan.Sultan questioned the science behind analyzing footprints. He introduced a March 2014 investigative report written by Bennett saying the partial footwear impression lacked certain detail and quality to be able to make a comparison.The home surveillance footageProsecutors used grainy footage from Hernandez's home security system to suggest he was holding a .45-caliber handgun -- the same kind of gun police said was used to kill Lloyd.Police: Hernandez 'agitated' and 'upset' after murder 02:29PLAY VIDEOHernandez could be seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after Lloyd was shot to death in an industrial park about a mile from Hernandez's home.""In my opinion the firearm shown in the video stills is a Glock pistol "" Glock sales manager Kyle Aspinwall testified.The video is time-stamped minutes after workers in a nearby industrial park describe hearing loud noises like fireworks -- the moment prosecutors say Lloyd was gunned down after getting out of a car Hernandez was driving.Hernandez's lawyers then showed a different part of the video time-stamped a few seconds earlier with Hernandez holding what appeared to be a shiny object in one hand suggesting it may be an iPad.""Glock pistols don't have white glows to them do they?"" defense attorney James Sultan asked.""No they do not "" Aspinwall answered.Sultan then displayed a soft-pellet gun similar in shape to a Glock suggesting it could also be the object Hernandez is holding.The possible motiveHernandez has pleaded not guilty in Lloyd's death. But already his arrest has led to deep consequences including his release from the New England Patriots and the loss of millions of dollars in expected earnings.So what might make a young man who had signed a $40 million contract risk everything?Judge grants field trip for jurors. Why? 01:48PLAY VIDEOProsecutors have said Lloyd might have done or said something that didn't sit well with Hernandez. They claimed Hernandez rounded up some friends and orchestrated a hit to settle the score.Hernandez's co-defendants Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately.But the case gets more complicated. Evidence collected in Lloyd's death investigation led to two more murder charges against Hernandez in a separate case in Boston.Hernandez is also accused of shooting Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado allegedly over a spilled drink at a nightclub. That double shooting took place in July 2012 almost a year before Lloyd was killed.Prosecutors have said in pretrial hearings that Hernandez may have been mad at himself for possibly showing Lloyd the spot where that double murder happened. During trial prosecutors suggest a text written by Hernandez the day before the murder saying he was ""buggin"" for showing Lloyd ""the spot"" may have played a role in plotting to kill Lloyd.The judge has banned any mention of the double murder in Lloyd's trial ruling it is prejudicial.Hernandez has pleaded not guilty in those deaths as well. But when the Lloyd trial ends that murder trial awaits him.",67,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/04/07/closing-arguments-due-in-first-phase-boston-marathon-bombing-trial/,Jurors in Boston Marathon bombing trial set to begin deliberations,"Did defense do enough to spare Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's life?Never autoplay videosBOSTON  Jurors in the trial of Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev are set to begin deliberations after both prosecutors and his lawyers told them Tsarnaev must be held accountable for participating in the terror attack.Deliberations are expected to begin Tuesday morning almost two years after twin bombs exploded near the marathon's finish line on April 15 2013 killing three people and wounding more than 260.During closing arguments Monday Tsarnaev's lawyers agreed with prosecutors that Tsarnaev conspired with his brother to bomb the marathon and planted one of two pressure-cooker bombs that exploded that day.But the defense said it was his now-dead older brother Tamerlan who was the mastermind of the attack.

We will terrorize you.'""Clarke argued that Tsarnaev fell under the influence of Tamerlan. Clarke repeatedly referred to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev then 19 as a ""kid"" and a ""teenager.""Prosecutors used their closing to remind the jury of the horror of that day showing photographs and video of the carnage and chaos after the shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bombs exploded. In one video jurors could hear the agonizing screams of Krystle Campbell a 29-year-old restaurant manager who bled to death on the sidewalk. Another woman and an 8-year-old boy also were killed.Taking aim at the argument that Tsarnaev was led astray by his older brother Chakravarty repeatedly referred to the Tsarnaevs as ""a team"" and ""partners"" in the attack.""That day they felt they were soldiers. They were the mujahedeen and they were bringing their battle to Boston "" the prosecutor said.Tamerlan Tsarnaev 26 died four days after the bombings after he was shot by police and run over by Dzhokhar during a getaway attempt.

Jurors in the murder trial of former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez asked Wednesday for a list of the 439 exhibits they have to sift through as they decide whether to convict him in the shooting death of another man.Twelve jurors were deliberating for the first full day after getting the case Tuesday afternoon. Judge Susan Garsh said Wednesday morning that she received a note asking for an exhibit list.Hernandez is charged with the June 2013 shooting death of Odin Lloyd a semi-professional football player who was dating his fiancee's sister. Lloyd was shot six times in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's home. At the time the star tight end had a $40 million contract with the Patriots.Hernandez lawyer James Sultan initially said he didn't want the jury to receive a detailed list because many of the exhibits are photos and jurors should decide for themselves what the photos show.He then said a more generic description might be OK. The judge asked both sides to meet to decide on a possible list.Hernandez was brought into the courtroom at the Fall River Justice Center several times Wednesday as lawyers discussed the list and other issues. At other times he was held in a cell at the courthouse to await word on a verdict.Lawyers and the judge hashed out disagreements earlier Wednesday over certain exhibits before they were given to jurors.The judge overruled the defense's request to block a picture of the redacted final text messages Lloyd sent to his sister. In the messages Lloyd tells his sister he is with ""NFL."" He was dead within minutes of sending his final message.Previously the judge said the jury would not be allowed to see the content of the texts but she did allow the timestamps.Jurors were then given the 439 exhibits and a verdict slip.Deliberations begin at 9 a.m. and go until 4:30 p.m. or later if jurors wish. They must come to a unanimous decision and are considering three charges: murder illegal possession of a firearm and illegal possession of ammunition. The murder charge carries a sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole if he is found guilty of 1st-degree murder or life in prison with the possibility of parole after 15 years if he is found guilty of 2nd-degree murder.His lawyer acknowledged for the first time Tuesday that Hernandez was there when Lloyd was killed. But he described him as a 23-year-old kid who did not know what to do. He pinned the killing on two of Hernandez's friends co-defendants Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz. Both men have pleaded not guilty and will be tried later.Prosecutors say Hernandez planned the crime drove Lloyd to a secluded area killed him and then tried to cover it up.",http://us.cnn.com/2015/04/06/us/aaron-hernandez-trial/index.html,Aaron Hernandez trial: Defense rests,"Story highlightsClosing arguments in the case are set for TuesdayAaron Hernandez is charged with first-degree murder in the killing of Odin LloydHis defense lawyers made their case on MondayWatch ""Downward Spiral: Inside the Case against Aaron Hernandez"" at 9 p.m. ET Tuesday.(CNN)It took prosecutors months to present 131 witnesses to support their claim that former NFL star Aaron Hernandez killed semi-pro player Odin Lloyd.On Monday Hernandez's defense gave its side of the story wrapping up its witnesses in less than a day.Hernandez 25 is on trial for the shooting death of Lloyd whose body was found in a Massachusetts industrial park in June 2013.Now that the defense has rested it won't be long before the jury begins deliberating.

And the only way you rebut it is if you put him on the stand.""When questioned by a defense attorney Kraft said that he'd never had any problems with Hernandez and that the player was always respectful to him.The fiancee's testimonyHernandez's fiancee Shayanna Jenkins revealed for the first time last week that Hernandez told her to dispose of a box from the couple's home that she said reeked of marijuana. She also said she didn't know what was in the box.Aaron Hernandez's fiance takes the stand 03:16PLAY VIDEOThat revelation may contradict the prosecution's contention that the weapon used in the killing was in the box. The murder weapon in the case has not been recovered.During cross-examination by the defense Jenkins testified that she suspected marijuana because the box smelled ""skunky.""Earlier she told prosecutors during direct examination that she didn't know what was in the box. She said Hernandez never told her and she never looked.After concealing the box with her daughter's clothing Jenkins said she threw it away in ""a random dumpster"" but could not remember exactly where.The pair of Air JordansMuch testimony has focused on the shoes Hernandez wore the night Lloyd was shot.A Nike consultant testified that Hernandez was wearing Nike Air Jordan Retro 11 Lows. About 93 000 pairs of that shoe were made significantly fewer in a size 13. The shoe's sole makes a distinct impression said Lt. Steven Bennett of the Massachusetts State Police.Do Hernandez's dance moves suggest a motive? 03:39PLAY VIDEOThe consultant testified under questioning from defense attorney Jamie Sultan that other Nike shoes -- more than 3 million -- make the same impression.Yet Bennett who works in crime scene services testified that the footprint left near Lloyd's body was ""in agreement"" or consistent with the Air Jordan Retro 11 Lows size 13.Although he did not have the shoes that Hernandez wore that night he used an identical pair to make his determination. Bennett did so by creating a transparency of the sole and laying it over a photo of the footwear impression. Jurors watched as he drew lines showing how the sole aligned with the impression.What may have been a key moment for the prosecution was quickly derailed by defense attorney Jamie Sultan.Sultan questioned the science behind analyzing footprints. He introduced a March 2014 investigative report written by Bennett saying the partial footwear impression lacked certain detail and quality to be able to make a comparison.The home surveillance footageProsecutors used grainy footage from Hernandez's home security system to suggest he was holding a .45-caliber handgun -- the same kind of gun police said was used to kill Lloyd.Police: Hernandez 'agitated' and 'upset' after murder 02:29PLAY VIDEOHernandez could be seen on camera pulling into his driveway minutes after Lloyd was shot to death in an industrial park about a mile from Hernandez's home.""In my opinion the firearm shown in the video stills is a Glock pistol "" Glock sales manager Kyle Aspinwall testified.The video is time-stamped minutes after workers in a nearby industrial park describe hearing loud noises like fireworks -- the moment prosecutors say Lloyd was gunned down after getting out of a car Hernandez was driving.Hernandez's lawyers then showed a different part of the video time-stamped a few seconds earlier with Hernandez holding what appeared to be a shiny object in one hand suggesting it may be an iPad.""Glock pistols don't have white glows to them do they?"" defense attorney James Sultan asked.""No they do not "" Aspinwall answered.Sultan then displayed a soft-pellet gun similar in shape to a Glock suggesting it could also be the object Hernandez is holding.The possible motiveHernandez has pleaded not guilty in Lloyd's death. But already his arrest has led to deep consequences including his release from the New England Patriots and the loss of millions of dollars in expected earnings.So what might make a young man who had signed a $40 million contract risk everything?Judge grants field trip for jurors. Why? 01:48PLAY VIDEOProsecutors have said Lloyd might have done or said something that didn't sit well with Hernandez. They claimed Hernandez rounded up some friends and orchestrated a hit to settle the score.Hernandez's co-defendants Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately.But the case gets more complicated. Evidence collected in Lloyd's death investigation led to two more murder charges against Hernandez in a separate case in Boston.Hernandez is also accused of shooting Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado allegedly over a spilled drink at a nightclub. That double shooting took place in July 2012 almost a year before Lloyd was killed.Prosecutors have said in pretrial hearings that Hernandez may have been mad at himself for possibly showing Lloyd the spot where that double murder happened. During trial prosecutors suggest a text written by Hernandez the day before the murder saying he was ""buggin"" for showing Lloyd ""the spot"" may have played a role in plotting to kill Lloyd.The judge has banned any mention of the double murder in Lloyd's trial ruling it is prejudicial.Hernandez has pleaded not guilty in those deaths as well. But when the Lloyd trial ends that murder trial awaits him.",69,http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/04/09/white-house-takes-shot-at-netanyahu-on-twitter/,White House swipes at Netanyahu with tweet of Iran bomb diagram," (AP)The White House took an apparent swipe at Benjamin Netanyahu on Twitter Wednesday posting a diagram similar to one used by the Israeli prime minister -- only this time using it to defend the Iran nuclear deal.The White House tweet included a cartoonish sketch of a bomb. On the left side were the supposed consequences of not striking a deal including resumed production of highly enriched uranium and no limits on that stockpile. On the right side were the supposed benefits of a deal including ""no production or stockpile of highly enriched uranium."" The sketch appeared to be almost identical to the one held up by Netanyahu during a 2012 United Nations speech. In that address he warned of the consequences of a nuclear-armed Iran and urged the world to prevent that outcome -- holding up the bomb diagram and dramatically drawing a red line near the top. The White House diagram includes the same red line and reads Under the framework for an Iran nuclear deal Iran's uranium enrichment pathway to a weapon will be shut down.In the tweet the fuse of the bomb is being cut with scissors. Though the message makes no mention of Israel it's an unmistakable reference to the prime minister's address and just the latest episode in rising tensions between the Obama and Netanyahu administrations over the nuclear talks. Netanyahu publicly opposed the deal framework announced last week in Switzerland and even demanded that any final deal include language affirming that Iran recognizes Israel's right to exist. Obama administration officials have rejected that appeal saying the talks will only focus on the nuclear issue. They also say they would never agree to a deal that threatens Israel's security. The Hill first reported on the tweet.

The ban had been in place since 2010.""We are convinced that at this stage there's no more need of such an embargo Russia's separate voluntary embargo "" Lavrov said according to the Russian news agency Tass.The decision was also applauded by Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif who called the move ""a step in the right direction.""""We are looking to ever expanding our relationship with our neighbors as well as with the rest of the world "" Zarif said in Madrid alongside his Spanish counterpart. ""But Russia is an important neighbor for us an important partner.""U.S.: Russian move isn't 'constructive'U.S. officials though were unimpressed.""We don't believe it's constructive at this time for Russia to move forward with this "" State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said at a news conference.Secretary of State John Kerry raised the U.S. government's concerns over the sale in a phone call with Lavrov on Monday Harf said.But shipment of the weapons system could begin at any moment after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree Monday lifting the ban presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said according to Tass.""The decree stipulates ... no delays "" Peskov said adding that it states that ""it comes into force on the day it was signed.""Israeli concernsThe Israeli government which opposes the preliminary agreement that was reached on Iran's nuclear program earlier this month said the Russian move was a troubling sign.""Even as Iran disavows article after article in the framework agreement that was announced last week the international community is beginning to ease restrictions on it "" Intelligence Minister Yuval Steinitz said in a statement. ""This is the direct result of the legitimacy that Iran is receiving from the nuclear deal being made with it.""Lavrov insisted that the S-300 missile system ""is of a purely defensive nature.""""It is not designed for attacks and will not put at risk the security of any regional state including Israel of course "" he said according to Tass.But Steinitz offered a different interpretation.""Instead of demanding that Iran desist from the terrorist activity that it is carrying out in the Middle East and throughout the world it is being allowed to arm itself with advanced weapons that will only increase its aggression "" he said.Tensions over nuclear talksThe framework agreement on Iran's nuclear program announced earlier this month after lengthy negotiations between Tehran and world powers was considered a breakthrough by many observers.But it faces stiff opposition from some quarters including Israel and members of the U.S. Congress.Negotiators also have to reach a comprehensive deal by the end of June with uncertainty still clouding several key issues such as the pace at which sanctions on Iran would be lifted.U.S. officials have said that military force remains an option to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons but that the aim is to achieve the goal through negotiations.""We have the capability to shut down set back and destroy the Iranian nuclear program and I believe the Iranians know that and understand that "" Defense Secretary Ashton Carter told CNN last week.It's unclear to what extent the sale of the S-300 missile system to Iran would affect the U.S. capability -- or that of other nations like Israel -- to strike Tehran's nuclear facilities.Shipment not seen breaching U.N. sanctionsHarf said Russia's lifting of the ban on the sale shouldn't create divisions in world powers' efforts to reach a final deal with Iran.""We don't think this will have an impact on unity in terms of inside the negotiating room "" she said.The countries negotiating with Iran are the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council -- China France Russia the United Kingdom and the United States -- plus Germany.Harf also said the United States doesn't believe the shipment of the Russian missile system to Iran would violate any U.N. Security Council sanctions.Iran meanwhile welcomed Moscow's announcement.""The expansion of cooperation [with Russia] and improving cooperation with other neighboring countries in various fields can be very effective in establishing sustainable stability and security in the region "" Defense Minister Brig.

Just years and years of punishment day after day as he grows up to deal with the lonely struggle of dealing with what he did.""Tsarnaev 21 was convicted this month of all 30 counts against him; 17 of those counts carry the death penalty for the murders of four -- Krystle Campbell 29; Lingzi Lu 23; Martin Richard 8; and Sean Collier 26.In deciding whether the former college student is executed for his crimes or spends the rest of his days in a high-security federal prison jurors must weigh the heinousness of his crime and the toll on his victims against so-called mitigating factors such as his relative youth mental health and family background and whether or not he is remorseful.He has shown no emotion as he sits in court and he has avoided eye contact with maimed bombing survivors and relatives of the dead.Last week federal prosecutors presented three days of gut-wrenching victim impact testimony including an array of images showing the victims as happy active people and edited videos that added a soundtrack featuring a loud explosion screams and panicked voices to the horrific bombing scene outside the Forum restaurant where Richard and Lu died.Boston Marathon bomber flips the bird at camera 01:55PLAY VIDEOLead defense attorney Judy Clarke -- a nationally known death penalty opponent -- has acknowledged that Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan set off the bombs and shot MIT campus cop Collier. But she is expected to build a narrative showing her client as a puppet of his dominant older brother.Tamerlan Tsarnaev who was 26 died in a gunbattle with Watertown Massachusetts police three days after the bombings.Clarke's colleague Bruck began that narrative in his opening statement by noting ""The man who conceived planned and led this crime is beyond our power to punish. Only the 19-year-old younger brother who helped is left.""Several members of Tsarnaev's family arrived in Boston over the weekend but the defense is closely guarding its witness list. The relatives who are at an undisclosed location after being forced to leave a suburban hotel apparently do not include his parents who divorced and returned to Dagestan before the April 15 2013 bombings.Court filings indicate that the defense plans to call expert witness Janet Vogelsang a sociologist to explain Tsarnaev's difficult upbringing as the overlooked child of immigrants -- displaced Russian Muslims whose American dream failed.Under federal law the jury's decision must be unanimous. A deadlocked jury would result in an automatic life sentence for Tsarnaev -- which means the defense only needs to convince one juror to spare his life.The Boston Globe reported over the weekend that fewer than 20% of those polled in Massachusetts favor the death penalty for Tsarnaev. The number is down substantially since the days after the bombings.",76,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/04/26/thousands-take-to-streets-in-baltimore-for-freddie-gray-rally/,Dozens arrested as Freddie Gray protests turn violent in Baltimore,"Police: Gray was not buckled into seatbeltNever autoplay videosBALTIMORE  A protest over the death of Freddie Gray who was critically injured in police custody started peacefully with thousands marching through downtown streets before the demonstration turned violent and volatile.The chaotic scene Saturday night prompted the first public remarks from Freddie Gray's twin sister who pleaded for peace at a news conference alongside the mayor.""My family wants to say can you all please please stop the violence?""

Fans were told to briefly stay inside the stadium until the police were able to clear an intersection outside of the venue.Meanwhile a smaller ""splinter group"" looted a convenience store and threw tables and chairs through storefront windows shattering the glass. One group smashed the window of a department store inside a downtown mall and at one point a protester tossed a flaming metal garbage can toward a line of police officers in riot gear as they tried to push back the crowd.Earlier a group of protesters smashed the windows of at least three police cars and got into fights with baseball fans outside a bar.Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said roughly 1 200 officers were deployed downtown and across the city to try and keep the peace. Batts said he believes the ""very violent agitators"" are not from Baltimore.""I'm proud of our residents "" Batts said.

""All the open spaces in Kathmandu are packed with people who are camping outdoors. When the aftershocks come you cannot imagine the fear. You can hear women and children crying.""With people fearing more quakes tens of thousands of Nepalese spent Saturday night outside under chilly skies or in cars and public buses. They were jolted awake by the aftershocks Sunday.Saturday's magnitude 7.8 earthquake spread horror from Kathmandu to small villages and to the slopes of Mount Everest triggering an avalanche that buried part of the base camp packed with foreign climbers preparing to make their summit attempts. At least 17 people died there and 61 were injured.The earthquake centered outside Kathmandu the capital was the worst to hit the South Asian nation in over 80 years. It destroyed swaths of the oldest neighborhoods of Kathmandu and was strong enough to be felt all across parts of India Bangladesh China's region of Tibet and Pakistan.By Sunday night authorities said at least 2 430 people had died in Nepal alone not including the 18 people that the Nepal Mountaineering Association says died in an earthquake-triggered avalanche on Mount Everest. Another 61 people died from the quake in India and a few in other neighboring countries. At least 721 of the deaths were in Kathmandu and the number of injured nationwide was upward of 5 000. With search and rescue efforts far from over it was unclear how much the death toll would rise.The State Department confirmed Sunday that three U.S. citizens died in Nepal Saturday.Dan Fredinburg a Google executive who described himself as an adventurer was among the dead.Google confirmed his death. Lawrence You the company's director of privacy posted online that Fredinburg was in Nepal with three other Google employees climbing Mount Everest. The other three he added are safe.According to the technology blog Re/Code Fredinburg was an experienced climber who co-founded in his spare time Google Adventure. The project aims to ""translate the Google Street View concept into extreme exotic locations like the summit of Mount Everest or the Great Barrier Reef off Australia "" according to Startup Grind a global startup community.Outside of the oldest neighborhoods many in Kathmandu were surprised by how few modern structures collapsed in the quake. The city is largely a collection of small poorly constructed brick apartment buildings.While aid workers cautioned that many buildings could have sustained serious structural damage it was also clear that the death toll would have been far higher had more buildings caved in.But aid workers warned that the situation could be far worse near the epicenter. The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake was centered near Lamjung about 50 miles northwest of Kathmandu in the Gorkha district.Roads to that area were blocked by landslides hindering rescue teams said chief district official Prakash Subedi. Teams were trekking through mountain trails to reach remote villages and helicopters would also be deployed he said by telephone.The aid group World Vision said in a statement that remote mountain communities including in Gorkha were totally unprepared for the level of destruction caused by the earthquake.Villages near the epicenter ""are literally perched on the sides of large mountain faces and are made from simple stone and rock construction. Many of these villages are only accessible by 4WD and then foot with some villages hours and even entire days' walks away from main roads at the best of times "" the group's local staff member Matt Darvas said in the statement.He said he was hearing that many of the villages may have been completely buried by rock falls.""It will likely be helicopter access only for these remote villages "" he said.Nepal's worst recorded earthquake in 1934 measured 8.0 and all but destroyed the cities of Kathmandu Bhaktapur and Patan.As day broke Sunday rescuers aided by international teams set out to dig through rubble of buildings -- concrete slabs bricks iron beams wood -- to look for survivors.In the Kalanki neighborhood of Kathmandu police rescuers finally extricated a man lying under a dead person both of them buried beneath a pile of concrete slabs and iron beams. Before his rescue his family members stood nearby crying and praying. Police said the man's legs and hips were totally crushed.Hundreds of people in Kalanki gathered around the collapsed Lumbini Guest House once a three-story budget hotel and restaurant frequented by Nepalese. They watched with fear and anticipation as a single backhoe dug into the rubble.Police officer RP Dhamala who was coordinating the rescue efforts said they had already pulled out 12 people alive and six dead. He said rescuers were still searching for about 20 people believed to be trapped but had heard no cries taps or noises for a while.Most areas were without power and water. The United Nations said hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overcrowded and running out of emergency supplies and space to store corpses. Plumes of smoke meanwhile rose above the capital as friends relatives and others gathered by the river to quickly cremate loved ones' remains.Most shops in Kathmandu were shut; only fruit vendors and pharmacies seemed to be doing business. Karki of Mercy Corps said there were long lines outside pharmacies because people fear they will run out of medicine.The quake will likely put a huge strain on the resources of this impoverished country best known for Everest the highest mountain in the world. The economy of Nepal a nation of 27.8 million people relies heavily on tourism principally trekking and Himalayan mountain climbing.With Kathmandu airport reopened the first aid flights began delivering aid supplies. The first to respond were Nepal's neighbors -- India China and Pakistan all of which have been jockeying for influence over the landlocked nation. Still Nepal remains closest to India with which it shares deep political cultural and religious ties.Indian air force planes landed Sunday with 43 tons of relief material including tents and food and nearly 200 rescuers India's External Affairs Ministry spokesman Vikas Swarup said. The planes were returning to New Delhi with Indian nationals stranded in Kathmandu. More aid flights were planned for Sunday.India suffered its own losses from the quake with at least 61 people killed there and dozens injured. Sunday's aftershock was also widely felt in the country and local news reports said metro trains in New Delhi and Kolkata were briefly shut down when the shaking started.An American military plane left Delaware's Dover Air Force Base for Nepal carrying 70 people including a disaster-assistance response team and an urban search-and-rescue team and 45 tons of cargo the Pentagon said.A 62-member Chinese search and rescue team also arrived Sunday. Other countries sending support Sunday included the United Arab Emirates Germany and France.Pakistan prepared to send four C-130 aircraft carrying a 30-bed temporary hospital comprising army doctors surgeons and specialists. An urban search and rescue team was also sent with ground-penetrating radars concrete cutters and sniffing dogs. Pakistan was also sending 2 000 ready-to-eat meal packs water bottles medicines 200 tents 600 blankets and other necessary items.When the earth first shook residents fled homes and buildings in panic as walls tumbled trees swayed power lines came crashing down and large cracks opened up on streets. After the chaos of Saturday -- when little organized rescue and relief was seen -- there was more order on Sunday as rescue teams fanned out across the city.Workers were sending out tents and relief goods in trucks and helicopters said disaster management official Rameshwar Dangal. He said government and private schools have been turned into shelters.Mukesh Kafle the head of the Nepal Electricity Authority said power has been restored fully to main government offices the airport and hospitals.Among the destroyed buildings in Kathmandu was the nine-story Dharahara Tower a Kathmandu landmark built by Nepal's royal rulers as a watchtower in the 1800s and a UNESCO-recognized historical monument.

Jurors will decide whether Tsarnaev should spend the rest of his life in prison or should be sentenced to death.Bruck says there's no punishment Tsarnaev can receive that would be equal to the suffering of the victims. He says ""There is no evening the scales.""Three people were killed and more than 260 others were injured in the twin bombings.",http://us.cnn.com/2015/04/28/us/tsarnaev-boston-bombing-sentencing/index.html,More secrets  arresting images at Boston bombing trial,"Story highlightsTranscript reveals behind-the-scenes legal dramaJury sees shocking photo of Tamerlan Tsarnaev in jihad poseDefense shifts focus to dead older brother in penalty phaseBoston (CNN)In a trial full of arresting images one that flashed across the courtroom screen on Tuesday was a stunner: Tamerlan Tsarnaev with a full beard and wearing traditional white Muslim robes flashed a pistol in front of what appeared to be the rallying flag of jihad.Yet another showed him brandishing a gun with a small child in the frame. And finally came a photo of an unidentified small boy carrying a rifle.It is not known when or where the photographs were taken.They came to light during the testimony of defense witness Mark Spencer a digital forensics expert from Arsenal Consultants.Spencer said the images were recovered from an encrypted file called ""Document"" on Tsarnaev's Samsung laptop after his death.Tamerlan Tsarnaev was shot by police and run over by his brother in the aftermath the deadly bombings at the 2013 Boston Marathon.How did Tsarnaevs prepare for Boston bombing? 01:43PLAY VIDEOThe defense expert delved into Tamerlan's computer files in much the same way federal prosecutors rooted through his younger brother's Sony laptop earlier in this trial.Tamerlan the heavy Jahar the pawnDzhokhar ""Jahar"" Tsarnaev was convicted of 30 counts relating to the bombings and their aftermath; 17 counts involving the murders of three marathon spectators and an MIT police officer carry the death penalty as a possible sentence.Defense attorneys are fighting to convince jurors to spare 21-year-old Jahar Tsarnaev from execution and instead sentence him to life in prison without parole. The defense strategy includes shifting the focus of the trial to Tamerlan's radical beliefs and the power he held over his younger brother. They are trying to make Tamerlan the heavy and Jahar his pawn.One of the witnesses a boxing coach who knew the brothers when they were younger spoke the words that surely were music to the defense attorneys' ears. Asked to describe Jahar John Curran said: ""I remember mentioning to somebody that he was like a puppy following his brother.""The subject of Tamerlan has dominated the testimony. Besides the computer expert and his former boxing coach witnesses have included his music teacher his mother-in-law his wife's best friend a handful of classmates and acquaintances and his landlady's son.They spoke about how he pursued a career as an amateur boxer but was disappointed when his lack of U.S. citizenship stifled his progress. He went from hard-drinking pot smoking drug dealer to clean-living devout stay-at-home dad.While he once was a flashy dresser who left a plume of aftershave behind him and wore boots the color of aluminum foil he began to walk the streets of Cambridge in the flowing robes of devout Muslims.All the while the defense says he obsessively trolled the Internet in search of the messages of violent jihad. His encrypted file included dozens of dead and maimed children apparently from conflicts abroad.The radicalization of Dzhokhar TsarnaevAccidental disclosureIn addition to Tuesday's testimony disclosures about the defense case and behind-the-scenes dramas involving the witnesses were accidentally disclosed in a transcript of defense attorney David Bruck's opening statement. Copies of the transcript were purchased by CNN and several other media outlets.The transcript inadvertently included sidebar conversations between Judge George O'Toole and the prosecution and defense teams. Those conversations usually are held in the judge's chambers or otherwise out of earshot of the jury and the public. At times the court plays soft jazz to prevent eavesdropping.How the Tsarnaevs' plan unraveled 01:15PLAY VIDEOBut the transcript revealed the following:One friend of Tamerlan's is missing and neither the defense nor the prosecution can find him.

Tsarnaev was convicted of the Boston Marathon bombings that killed three and injured 260 people in April 2013. (AP Photo/Steven Senne) (The Associated Press)10:28 a.m.A computer expert testifying for the defense in the trial of Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (joh-HAHR' tsahr-NEYE'-ehv) says his brother Tamerlan's wife did research on her computer to try to find out what the rewards would be for the wife of someone who dies as a martyr fighting in a holy war.Mark Spencer testified Tuesday that Katherine Russell's computer showed search terms more than a year before the bombings that included: ""rewards for wife of mujahedeen"" and ""if your husband becomes a shahid what are the rewards for you?""Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's lawyers have argued that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was the mastermind of the bombings and led his younger brother Dzhokhar down the path to terrorism.

And finally came a photo of an unidentified small boy carrying a rifle.It is not known when or where the photographs were taken.They came to light during the testimony of defense witness Mark Spencer a digital forensics expert from Arsenal Consultants.Spencer said the images were recovered from an encrypted file called ""Document"" on Tsarnaev's Samsung laptop after his death.Tamerlan Tsarnaev was shot by police and run over by his brother in the aftermath the deadly bombings at the 2013 Boston Marathon.How did Tsarnaevs prepare for Boston bombing? 01:43PLAY VIDEOThe defense expert delved into Tamerlan's computer files in much the same way federal prosecutors rooted through his younger brother's Sony laptop earlier in this trial.Tamerlan the heavy Jahar the pawnDzhokhar ""Jahar"" Tsarnaev was convicted of 30 counts relating to the bombings and their aftermath; 17 counts involving the murders of three marathon spectators and an MIT police officer carry the death penalty as a possible sentence.Defense attorneys are fighting to convince jurors to spare 21-year-old Jahar Tsarnaev from execution and instead sentence him to life in prison without parole. The defense strategy includes shifting the focus of the trial to Tamerlan's radical beliefs and the power he held over his younger brother. They are trying to make Tamerlan the heavy and Jahar his pawn.One of the witnesses a boxing coach who knew the brothers when they were younger spoke the words that surely were music to the defense attorneys' ears. Asked to describe Jahar John Curran said: ""I remember mentioning to somebody that he was like a puppy following his brother.""The subject of Tamerlan has dominated the testimony. Besides the computer expert and his former boxing coach witnesses have included his music teacher his mother-in-law his wife's best friend a handful of classmates and acquaintances and his landlady's son.They spoke about how he pursued a career as an amateur boxer but was disappointed when his lack of U.S. citizenship stifled his progress. He went from hard-drinking pot smoking drug dealer to clean-living devout stay-at-home dad.While he once was a flashy dresser who left a plume of aftershave behind him and wore boots the color of aluminum foil he began to walk the streets of Cambridge in the flowing robes of devout Muslims.All the while the defense says he obsessively trolled the Internet in search of the messages of violent jihad. His encrypted file included dozens of dead and maimed children apparently from conflicts abroad.The radicalization of Dzhokhar TsarnaevAccidental disclosureIn addition to Tuesday's testimony disclosures about the defense case and behind-the-scenes dramas involving the witnesses were accidentally disclosed in a transcript of defense attorney David Bruck's opening statement.

Mosby said the police had no basis for arresting Gray who police said avoided eye contact and was carrying a switchblade. One police officer identified as Caesar Goodson 45 was charged with second-degree murder while others were charged with crimes including manslaughter and assault.""No one is above the law "" declared Mosby who said she comes from three generations of law enforcement and has been on the job for four months. Her husband is Baltimore City Councilman Nick Mosby who has spoken out about the riots and anger in the city's African-American community.Gray suffered a broken neck apparently while riding in the back of the Baltimore police van. Mosby said Friday the medical examiner had ruled the death a homicide. Police sources have said his injuries may have been caused by his head hitting a bolt inside the vehicle according to local reports citing sources familiar with a police report now in the hands of state prosecutors.The charges leveled against the police include:- Goodson was charged with second-degree depraved-heart murder involuntary manslaughter second-degree negligent assault as well as other charges including failure to render aid and misconduct in office.More on this...Has social media exasperated the problems in Baltimore?- Police Officer William Porter was charged with involuntary manslaughter second-degree assault and misconduct in office.- Police Lt. Brian Rice was charged with involuntary manslaughter and second-degree assault.- Police Officer Alicia White was charged with involuntary manslaughter second degree assault and misconduct in office.- Police officers Edward Nero and Garrett Miller were charged with multiple counts of assault false imprisonment and misconduct in office.The Baltimore police officers union issued a statement before Mosby's announcement saying the six officers are not responsible for Gray's death.""As tragic as this situation is none of the officers involved are responsible for the death of Mr. Gray "" Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3 President Gene Ryan said in a statement. ""To the contrary at all times each of the officers diligently balanced their obligations to protect Mr. Gray and discharge their duties to protect the public.""Gray died a week later on April 19. Until Friday's news conference few details about the investigation had been publicly released and most of what was known came from local reports citing unnamed sources. An explosive report Wednesday night in the Washington Post cited a fellow passenger's account in a police affidavit that said Gray was thrashing around in an effort to injure himself although that witness went on the city's CBS affiliate to say his words were taken out of context and that he now fears for his life after his statement was used to bolster the police version of events.When I was in the back of that van it did not stop or nothing "" Danta Allen who had been arrested for allegedly stealing a cigarette told WJZ. ""All it did was go straight to the station but I heard a little banging like he was banging his head Allen said. I didnt even know he was in the van until we got to the station.Gray's lawyer has said his spine was nearly severed but results of an autopsy like the police report remained under wraps. That has fueled frustration and suspicion in the community where peaceful protests devolved into rioting and looting culminating in a night of chaos on Monday.On Thursday Police Commissioner Anthony Batts disclosed that the police van made a previously undisclosed stop one of three stops made while transporting Gray to a hospital. The mystery stop was captured by a privately-owned security camera and could be crucial to the police investigation into Gray's death.Although Gray was reportedly shackled to the bed of the van by leg irons police sources told ABC affiliate WJLA that he was standing without a seat belt on. Just over a week prior to Gray's arrest - for running from police who tried to stop him the Baltimore Police Department issued a new policy making it obligatory to buckle in all inmates being transported in police vans.Batts said his departments report was delivered a day ahead of time to the States Attorney Marilyn Mosby and the commissioner said any questions about it should go to her.Mosby decline to speak publicly Thursday as she issued a statement asking for ""for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system.""Last week Batts said the additional passenger who was picked up along the way had told investigators the driver did not speed make sudden stops or ""drive erratically"" during the trip and that Gray was ""was still moving around that he was kicking and making noises"" up until the van arrived at the police station.The Gray family's lawyers sought to dispel the idea that the police report would be made public at this point.""This family wants justice and they want justice that comes at the right time and not too soon "" attorney Hassan Murphy said Wednesday.Meanwhile protesters over Grays death continue to spread across the nation. Aside from gatherings in Baltimore demonstrations spread into Philadelphia and New York Thursday.Philly.com reports that Philadelphia police made three or four arrests after hundreds of protesters marched through the city to show support for Gray.More demonstrations are planned through the weekend.The Associated Press contributed to this report",http://us.cnn.com/2015/05/01/us/freddie-gray-officers-actions/index.html,Freddie Gray case: Actions that led to charges,"Story highlightsFreddie Gray suffered fatal spinal injury while being transported in police van prosecutor saysSix police officers are charged in Gray's deathWatch a special report ""Police Under Fire "" Monday at 9 p.m. ET/PT.(CNN)In publicly outlining her case against six police officers in the death of Freddie Gray Baltimore's chief prosecutor faulted what they did -- and did not do.Among the allegations: Failure to find probable cause illegal arrest failure to seek or render medical aid gross negligence and misconduct.""The findings of our comprehensive thorough and independent investigation coupled with the medical examiner's determination that Mr. Gray's death was a homicide ... has led us to believe that we have probable cause to file criminal charges "" State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby told reporters from the broad steps of the downtown War Memorial.Gray suffered a fatal spinal injury on April 12 while being transported ""handcuffed shackled by his feet and unrestrained"" in a police van Mosby said.Michael Davey an attorney for the Baltimore Fraternal Order of Police who spoke on behalf of the six officers and their attorneys told reporters that none of the officers injured or harmed Gray. ""They are truly saddened by his death "" Davey said. ""These officers did nothing wrong.""These are the actions that Mosby said resulted in the charges against the six based on the statement of probable cause:Officer Garrett E. MillerMiller 26 who joined the force in 2012 was one of three officers on bike patrol on the morning of April 12 in Baltimore. One of the other officers made eye contact with Gray who began running.Gray eventually surrendered and was handcuffed. He was ""placed in a prone position with his arms handcuffed behind his back. It was at this time that Mr. Gray indicated that he could not breathe and requested an inhaler to no avail "" Mosby said.Officer Garrett E. MillerMiller and another officer placed Gray in a seated position. They found a knife in his pants pocket. The blade of the knife was folded into the handle. It was not a switchblade and legal to carry under Maryland law.""Mr. Gray was placed back down on his stomach at which time Mr. Gray began to flail his legs and scream as Officer Miller placed Mr. Gray in a restraining technique known as a leg lace "" the prosecutor said.The three officers failed to establish probable cause for Gray's arrest. No crime had been committed. The arrest was illegal Mosby said.When the police van arrived Miller and the two other officers loaded Gray into the wagon. At no point was Gray secured by a seat belt as is required. A while later at Baker Street Miller and the officers removed Gray from the wagon placed handcuffs on his wrists and leg shackles on his ankles. They completed paperwork before loading Gray back into the wagon. He was placed on his stomach headfirst on the floor.Miller is charged with two counts of second-degree assault two counts of misconduct in office and one count of false imprisonment.Lt. Brian W. RiceRice 41 an officer since 1997 was one of the officers on bike patrol during the initial encounter with Gray. He made eye contact with Gray who then ran. Rice and others failed to establish probable cause for Gray's illegal arrest. Later Rice and two other officers handcuffed Gray and put shackles on his ankles. The officers placed Gray back on the floor of the wagon face down.Lt. Brian W. RiceRice is charged with one count of involuntary manslaughter two counts of second-degree assault two counts of misconduct in office and one count of false imprisonment.Separately records from the Carroll County Maryland Sheriff's Department show that Rice was taken to a hospital in 2012 because of concerns about his mental health.The concerns were raised by another officer who is also the mother of Rice's child according to the records. At the time deputies confiscated Rice's guns and alerted his superiors in Baltimore.The records show that Rice said he ""could not continue to go on like this"" and threatened to do something in his laundry room if the mother of his child ""did not come over to his residence."" His specific threat was redacted from the documents. It's unclear how long Rice was at the hospital.Rice could not be reached for comment.Officer Edward M. NeroOfficer Edward M. NeroNero 29 on the job since 2012 was the third officer on bike patrol when Gray was arrested. Mosby said Nero held Gray down until the wagon arrived. Along with Rice and Miller Nero failed to establish probable cause for what Mosby called an illegal arrest. Nero also assisted Rice and Miller later in cuffing and shackling Gray.He is charged with two counts of second-degree assault two counts of misconduct in office and one count of false imprisonment.Officer Caesar R. Goodson Jr.Goodson 45 who joined the police department in 1999 drove the transport wagon. He had been directed to deliver Gray to the central booking facility.At one point Goodson parked the van to check on his prisoner.Officer Caesar R. Goodson Jr.""Despite stopping for the purpose of checking on Mr. Gray's condition at no point did he seek nor did he render any medical assistance for Mr. Gray "" Mosby said.Goodson returned to the driver's seat and headed toward central booking with Gray still unsecured. After several blocks the officer called dispatch to say he needed to check on his prisoner. He requested additional units.Another officer arrived and with Goodson went to the back of the wagon. Gray requested help and said he could not breathe. One officer asked Gray if he needed a medic. Twice Gray said he needed medical assistance. The officer helped lift Gray from the floor to a bench in the van.Again the officers failed to restrain Gray or request medical assistance. Goodson then responded to a separate call for assistance in an arrest.""Despite Mr. Gray's obvious and recognized need for medical assistance Officer Goodson in a grossly negligent manner chose to respond ... with Gray still unsecured by a seat belt in the wagon without rendering or summoning medical assistance "" Mosby said.At the next stop Goodson was met by Miller and three other officers. He walked to the back of the wagon to check on Gray. Goodson and the other officers saw that Gray was unresponsive.Still Goodson picked up a new prisoner and drove to a police station to drop him off. He failed to restrain Gray for at least the fifth time Mosby said. Gray was no longer breathing.Goodson is charged with one count of second-degree depraved-heart murder involuntary manslaughter second-degree assault manslaughter by vehicle (gross negligence) manslaughter by vehicle (criminal negligence) and misconduct in office.CNN legal analyst Sonny Hostin said the depraved-heart murder charge appeared to indicate the prosecutor believes Goodson was ""one of the worst actors"" in Gray's death.""Depraved heart means he intentionally willfully and deliberately acted with depraved indifference to human life "" she said.Sgt. Alicia D. WhiteWhite 30 an officer since 2010 was present during one of the stops to check on Gray's condition. White and two other officers saw that Gray was unresponsive on the floor of the wagon.White who was responsible for investigating two citizen complaints related to Gray's arrest spoke to the back of the prisoner's head.Sgt. Alicia D. WhiteWhen Gray did not respond White allegedly did nothing. She had been advised that Gray needed a medic but made no effort to assess his condition.""Despite Mr. Gray's seriously deteriorating medical condition no medical assistance was rendered or summoned for Mr. Gray at that time by any officer "" Mosby said.Later White and two other officers attempted to remove Gray from the wagon. He was no longer breathing. A medic later determined Gray was in ""cardiac arrest and ... critically and severely injured.""Gray was rushed to the University of Maryland's Shock Trauma Center where he underwent surgery. On April 19 he was pronounced dead from his injuries.""The manner of death deemed a homicide by the Maryland State Medical Examiner is believed to be the result of a fatal injury that occurred while Mr. Gray was unrestrained by a seat belt in the custody of the Baltimore Police Department wagon "" Mosby said.White is charged with one count of involuntary manslaughter second-degree assault and misconduct in office.Officer William G. PorterOfficer William G. PorterPorter 25 who joined the force in 2012 responded when Goodson asked for additional units to check on Gray. The prisoner told Porter he could not breathe. Porter asked Gray if he needed a medic. Gray said ""yes"" twice. The officer helped lift Gray to a bench but did not assess his condition or call for medical assistance. Porter also was present later when Goodson picked up another prisoner and White and others discovered that Gray was unresponsive.Porter is charged with one count of involuntary manslaughter second-degree assault and misconduct in office.",83,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/04/19/hundreds-feared-dead-after-migrant-boat-capsizes/,Hundreds feared dead after migrant boat capsizes in Mediterranean Sea,"A major rescue operation is underway in the Mediterranean Sea north of Libya and south of the Italian island of Lampedusa after a migrant ship carrying as many as 700 people capsized Sunday.Italy's Coast Guard said at least 24 people are confirmed dead with the death toll expected to rise into the hundreds. BBC reports that only 28 people have been rescued so far. Italian and Maltese ships were involved in the search and rescue operation. Maltese Prime Minister Joseph Muscat put the number of survivors at 50.It was not clear whether Muscat's figure included the 28 survivors reported by Italy. Maltese search units were aiding rescue efforts.The Coast Guard said in a statement that the migrants' 66-foot vessel may have overturned because migrants rushed to one side of the craft when they saw a Portuguese merchant vessel approach it late Saturday night. The cargo ship had been dispatched to come to the migrants' aid.Muscat said rescuers were seeing people in the sea and were ""checking who is alive and who is dead.""The capsizing of such a crowded boat represented the ""biggest human tragedy of the last few years "" Muscat said.A United Nations refugee agency spokeswoman Carlotta Sami tweeted that according to one survivor the boat had set out with 700 migrants aboard.But the Coast Guard and other authorities said they had no immediate way to determine how many were aboard or how many might still be rescued. The total number of passengers was expected to be clarified as officers interviewed survivors. Given the depth of the sea -- as deep as 3 miles or more in the area -- it was possible that many bodies would never be recovered. This has commonly been the case in similar tragedies off the coasts of Libya Italy and other Mediterranean nations in recent years.Pope Francis was among those following the news. ""There are fears there could be hundreds of dead "" Francis told the faithful in St. Peter's Square. He bowed his head in silent prayer as did many of the tens of thousands in the crowd. For a second day running he called on Europe to do more to help Italy manage its continent-leading flow of migrants.Italian Premier Matteo Renzi summoned his top ministers to a Sunday night meeting in Rome to discuss the latest tragedy.""The numbers (of the dead) are still provisional but the numbers are destined to rise "" Renzi said. ""How can it be that we daily are witnessing a tragedy?""Rescuers reported seeing wreckage in the sea.""There are large fuel stains pieces of wood life jackets "" Italian Border Police Gen. Antonino Iraso whose force has boats deployed in the rescue effort told Sky TG24 TV.When asked whether the boat capsized because the migrants rushed to one side as the Portuguese vessel pulled alongside Iraso replied: ""The dynamics aren't clear. But this is not the first time that has happened.""The numbers of migrants attempting the dangerous crossing by sea from Libya swells as the springtime weather improves providing calmer seas and warmer water temperatures. But the smugglers' boats are frequently overcrowded or unseaworthy.So far this year more than 900 have died in failed crossings. Last week 400 people were presumed drowned when another boat capsized.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

As a ship full of rescuers approached the migrants all moved to one side of their boat hoping to be saved. Their movement caused the boat to capsize sending the desperate crowd plunging into the frigid waters where the chance of survival is slim.Urgent rescue operations were underway Sunday with authorities estimating there may have been as many as 700 people on the ship.Some were rescued. Flavio Di Giacomo spokesman for the International Organization for Migration told CNN that 49 survivors were recovered and being taken to Sicily. But the Italian Coast Guard which is leading the rescue operation reported that 28 survivors and 24 bodies have been recovered so far in the area about 110 kilometers (70 miles) north of Libya.It's ""genocide -- nothing less than genocide really "" Malta's Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said in an interview with CNN. Malta is working with Italy in the rescue operations.""Our troops together with the Italian navy are literally looking through the bodies to try to find someone who's still alive "" Muscat said.While the capsizing was an accident human traffickers are involved in putting people on rickety unsafe ships that risk their lives.""Gangs of criminals are putting people on a boat sometimes even at gunpoint "" Muscat said. ""They're putting them on the road to death really and nothing else.""Security for Libya's borders is essential to ""take out these criminal gangs -- these terrorists "" Muscat said. The international community ""cannot continue to turn a blind eye "" he added.The vessel was large and had multiple levels Italian Coast Guard spokeswoman Francesca Caruso said.Many of the migrants are from sub-Saharan Africa and travel for weeks just to get to the ships. They're seeking a better life but many are exploited by the traffickers who organize the voyages.Already this year more than 900 migrants are believed to have died while crossing the Mediterranean -- far more than during the same period in 2014 the International Organization for Migration said Friday.In one four-day period alone more than 8 000 migrants were rescued according to the Italian Coast Guard. On one day alone SOS calls came in from 20 boats in distress.Roberta Metsola a Maltese member of the European Parliament told CNN on Sunday that countries from Northern Europe need to share the responsibility with their southern neighbors.""The people are going to continue to arrive "" she said. ""The desperation subsists -- there are almost a million people waiting to board boats and come to Europe to seek a better life.

His partner Officer Erik Jansen 30 radioed for help.""They did not have an opportunity to get out and return fire "" the commissioner said at a Saturday night news conference at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center with Mayor Bill de Blasio and other officials.Law enforcement flooded the Queens Village neighborhood following the shooting -- police helicopters flew overhead officers searched house by house and some could be seen walking on roofs. About 90 minutes later police arrested Demetrius Blackwell 35 near the crime scene in a house on the block where he lives officials said.Blackwell was charged with attempted murder and criminal possession of a weapon police said Sunday morning. No weapon was found.After the shooting witnesses described Blackwell to responding officers and pointed them in the direction he ran Bratton said.De Blasio said the shooting was a painful reminder of the risks officers take every day.""Our hearts are with his family his loved ones "" the mayor said. ""Our hearts are with his extended family the men and women of the NYPD.""Moore who comes from a family of police officers has been on the job since July 2010.The shooting instantly evoked fears of the December slayings of two uniformed officers as they sat in their patrol cars in Brooklyn by a man who posted online that he was seeking retribution against officers for the death of Eric Garner in an apparent chokehold by police.The shootings of Officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos strained an already tense relationship between city police unions and de Blasio. Patrolmen's Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch turned his back on the mayor at a hospital the day of the killings and said de Blasio had ""blood on his hands.""But Saturday night Lynch was among the officials who attended the news conference and could be seen shaking the mayor's hand and speaking briefly with him afterward.Bratton said Blackwell has a criminal record that includes a weapons possession charge but the suspect made no such anti-police postings and was being pursued by the anti-crime officers because of his behavior.Neighbors near the scene of the shooting were surprised by the violence and described the residential area with many two- and three-family homes as quiet and safe.""You walk down the street no trouble "" said Sandreaus Adam 52.

It is the first time ISIS has taken credit for an attack on U.S. soil though it was not immediately clear whether the group's claim was an opportunistic co-opting of a so-called ""lone wolf"" attack as its own.The message described the shooting suspects as ""two soldiers of the caliphate"" and added ""We tell America that what is coming is more bitter and harder and you will see from the soldiers of the Caliphate what harms you.""The message also said the contest which was being put on by a group known for controversial rhetoric about Islam ""was portraying negative images of the Prophet Muhammad.""House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Michael McCaul R-Texas told Fox News Tuesday that the attack was terrorism and at the very least inspired by ISIS.McCaul also said in the days leading up to the attack a joint FBI and Homeland Security bulletin was circulated and security for the event had been ramped up as a result in Garland understanding that it was a target.More on this...Investigators looking into tweets sent about Texas shootingAn investigation following the attack revealed a striking connection between at least one of the gunmen and a Twitter account based overseas suggesting that ISIS operatives had knowledge of the attack beforehand and that the same fighters encouraged the shooters a counterterrorism source told Fox News.One British-based jihadi in Syria who does not tweet on a regular basis sent out a message within an hour of the attack praising both men.Another established ISIS Twitter account suggested he had been in contact with one of the gunmen just prior to the attack using messages such as he tried to reach him but just missed him. The source said the social media appeared to show encouragement and mentoring.The contest had been expected to draw outrage from the Muslim community. According to mainstream Islamic tradition any physical depiction of Muhammad even a respectful one is considered blasphemous and drawings similar to those featured at the Texas event have sparked violence around the world.Authorities say the suspects identified as Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi drove up to the building where the contest was being held in the Dallas suburb of Garland and opened fire. An unarmed school district security guard was wounded before a Garland police officer returned fire and killed both men.Soofi had a long standing hatred of police and had studied overseas in Islamabad Pakistan according to a Facebook account that has since been disabled.He once owned a pizza and hot wings restaurant in Phoenix called Cleopatra but sold it years ago as it was struggling the New York Times reports.Public records showed that Soofi and Simpson were living in the same apartment complex in Phoenix but it was not clear if they lived together according to the newspaper.Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said in a statement Monday that law enforcement authorities are investigating the men's motives and all circumstances surrounding the attack.Court documents show that Simpson had first been noticed by the FBI in 2006 due to his ties to a a former U.S. Navy sailor who had been arrested in Phoenix and was ultimately convicted of terrorism-related charges. In 2010 Simpson was arrested one day before he was scheduled to fly to South Africa to undertake what he claimed were religious studies at a madrassa. Recordings played at Simpson's trial indicated that he was using his studies as an excuse to travel to Somalia to link up with militant fighters there.Despite the more than 1 500 hours of recorded conversations including Simpson's discussions about fighting nonbelievers for Allah whom he referred to as ""kuffars"" the government prosecuted him on only one minor charge lying to a federal agent. He faced three years of probation and $600 in fines and court fees.There have been numerous attacks in Western countries believed related in some way to the group which holds roughly a third of Iraq and Syria.In October Canada was hit by two terror attacks by so-called ""lone wolves"" believed to have been inspired by the Islamic State group.

The official was not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation by name and spoke on condition of anonymity.It has previously been reported that Simpson was on investigators' radar because of his social media presence. A final tweet from an account linked to Simpson was posted about 20 minutes before the attack and said: ""May Allah accept us as mujahideen "" or holy warriors. Among the hashtags used by the account was ""#texasattack.""Rep. Michael McCaul R-Texas the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee said Tuesday that authorities had been tracking that Twitter account. He also said that the Department of Homeland Security and the FBI had issued a joint intelligence bulletin to local law enforcement April 20 warning that the Garland event was a possible target for a terrorist attack. The bulletin said that social media accounts linked to extremists had been focusing on the contest. McCaul said that the bulletin had resulted in increased security around the event. According to mainstream Islamic tradition any physical depiction of the Prophet Muhammad even a respectful one is considered blasphemous.The Islamic State group also known as ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack in an audio statement Tuesday. The statement on the extremist group's Syria-based Al Bayan radio station called the men ""two soldiers of the caliphate.""McCaul said Tuesday that the evidence does not indicate the attack was directed by the Islamic State group ""but rather inspired by them ... This is the textbook case of what we're most concerned about.""However a counterterrorism source told Fox News Tuesday that data mining in the wake of the Texas attack has revealed a striking connection between at least one of the gunmen and established twitter handled overseas suggesting that ISIS operatives had knowledge of the attack beforehand and that the same fighters mentored or encouraged at least one of the shooters.  Within several hours of the attack the source said established ISIS twitter handles had ""timely knowledge of the attack "" suggesting foreknowledge of the plot. Those handles included a British jihadi in Syria who does not tweet on a regular basis yet praised both gunmen within an hour of the shooting.A second established ISIS Twitter handle suggested he had been in contact with one of the shooters prior to the attack using phrases suggesting that he tried to reach the attacker but just missed him. The source said the social media appeared to show encouragement and mentoring.The law enforcement official told AP investigators will be studying the contacts Simpson and Soofi had prior to the shooting both with associates in the U.S. and abroad to determine any terror-related ties.The families of Simpson and Soofi say they were shocked by what happened and never saw any signs that either of them was capable of such violence.Simpson who was born in Illinois was arrested in 2010 after being the focus of a four-year terror investigation. But despite amassing more than 1 500 hours of recorded conversations including Simpson's discussions about fighting nonbelievers for Allah and plans to link up with ""brothers"" in Somalia the government prosecuted him on only one minor charge lying to a federal agent. He was sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to pay $600 in fines and court fees.It's unclear at what point in his life Simpson turned radical nor was it immediately clear when or how he met Soofi. Soofi did not appear to leave as big an online footprint as Simpson. However  according to a Facebook account that has now been disabled the 34-year-old had a longstanding hatred of police and had studied overseas in Pakistan.Soofi who was born in the Dallas area was an undergraduate pre-medicine major at the University of Utah from fall of 1998 to the summer of 2003 said university spokeswoman Maria O'Mara. She said he did not earn a degree.Utah court records show Soofi had several brushes with police during his time in the state.

Police returned fire killing both men after one wounded a security guard.None of the approximately 200 people attending the event were hurt.A federal law enforcement source told CNN's Susan Candiotti that one of the two men was a Phoenix resident who was convicted in 2011 of a terror-related charge. Elton Simpson is thought to have sent a tweet before the attack that read in part ""May Allah accept us as mujahideen "" the source said. It bore the hashtag #texasattack.""The attack bears similarities to the attacks this year on events in France and Denmark featuring images of Mohammed which some Muslims believe is blasphemous.The keynote speaker at the event in Garland was right-wing Dutch politician Geert Wilders who was placed on an al Qaeda hit list. It was organized by the American Freedom Defense Initiative -- considered an anti-Muslim group by the Southern Poverty Law Center which tracks hate groups.What is the American Freedom Defense Initiative?Gunmen killed at Mohammed cartoon event 01:54PLAY VIDEO""The Islamic jihadis are determined to suppress our freedom of speech violently."" Pamela Geller president of the American Freedom Defense Initiative told CNN. ""They struck in Paris and Copenhagen recently and now in Texas.""While authorities have yet to release more details about the men including their religion or motive the federal law enforcement source said one was Simpson.Simpson was convicted in 2011 of making a false statement involving international and domestic terrorism and sentenced to three years of probation court records show. Prosecutors said he told FBI agents that he had not discussed traveling to Somalia to engage in ""violent jihad"" when in fact he had according to an indictment reviewed by CNN.FBI agents were searching the Phoenix apartment where the suspects lived said John Iannarelli assistant special agent in charge of the agency's Phoenix office.They haven't found anyone else at the apartment and are working to collect evidence he said.Why Islam forbids images of MohammedExchange lasted secondsThe men drove up to the Curtis Culwell Center in Garland got out of their car and began shooting just as the ""Muhammad Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest"" inside was ending around 7 p.m. (8 p.m. ET) according to police.An unarmed security guard Bruce Joiner was shot in the ankle. He was later treated at a hospital and released Garland police spokesman Joe Harn told reporters.Garland police who were helping with security fired back killing both gunmen. The exchange lasted about 15 seconds police said.""The first suspect was shot immediately "" Garland Mayor Douglas Athas told CNN. ""The second suspect was wounded and reached for his backpack. He was shot again.""""We have no other indication that anyone else was involved "" Athas said.Early Monday morning FBI and local officials were checking the gunmen's vehicle for explosives and the area around the center was blocked off.Surrounding businesses were evacuated as were attendees from the Curtis Culwell Center.An officer first told audience members to stay where they were. Seconds later there was an announcement on the PA system by a SWAT team officer. He said ""Hey there has been a shooting outside the venue. We need to escort you out of the room.""A man in military fatigues herded the attendees into an auditorium.""There was an incident outside "" the officer said. ""Two suspects have been shot. Possibly have explosives on 'em OK? I just need everybody to remain calm become orderly and we're going to take you into the auditorium a little further away from the front of this building. All right?""Someone asked ""Were the suspects Muslim?""""I have no idea right now "" he responded.There is no immediate threat to the area police said; the check for explosives was a precaution.""It's a very slow tedious operation that goes on "" Harn said.Heavy security for eventThe American Freedom Defense Initiative said it specifically picked the venue a school district-owned facility because it hosted an event denouncing Islamophobia in January.The Sunday night event invited cartoonists to send in caricatures of Mohammed. The group said it received more than 350 submissions. The winning entry would get $10 000.There were about 200 people at the event police said.""Most of the people who were there were from out of state "" Athas said.Security was tight. The school district brought in extra officers and the group itself hired several more. Security costs the group said were upwards of $30 000.Only those who purchased tickets ahead of time were admitted. They had to go through metal detectors.""We were prepared for something like this "" Harn said.Depiction considered blasphemyMany Muslims consider depictions of Mohammed blasphemous.The prohibition against illustrating the prophet began as an attempt to ward off idol worship which was widespread in Islam's Arabian birthplace. But in recent years it has taken a deadly toll.In January gunmen attacked the offices of Charlie Hebdo a French satirical magazine that has a controversial history of depicting Mohammed and killed 12 people.The next month a gunman attacked a free speech forum in Copenhagen Denmark featuring cartoonist Lars Vilks who infuriated al Qaeda with his depictions of Mohammed.In the United States cartoonist Molly Norris is still in hiding four years after she depicted the likeness of Mohammed on several items and was deemed a ""prime target"" for execution by Islamic extremists.Shortly after the Sunday night shooting a prominent Muslim leader in Dallas tweeted about it.""The community stayed away from event "" Imam Zia Sheikh wrote. ""Seems like a lone wolf type of attack. Just what we didn't want.""'Freedom of speech is under violent assault'Wilders the Dutch politician who was the keynote speaker at the Garland event is controversial for his anti-Islam views. He was placed on an al Qaeda hit list for his film ""Fitna.""The film which Wilders released online in March 2008 to international outcry features disturbing images of terrorist acts superimposed over verses from the Quran in an apparent attempt to paint Islam as a threat to Western society.In 2011 Wilders was cleared of charges of inciting discrimination and hatred with the movie.""The day we give away humor and freedom of speech is the day that we cease to exist as a free and independent people "" he told the attendees at the Garland event Sunday night.Likewise the American Freedom Defense Initiative is known for its anti-Muslim stance.Geller its president is ""the anti-Muslim movement's most visible and flamboyant figurehead "" the SPLC says.""Who designated the SPLC as a legitimate authority? They are a radical leftist group who targets patriots vets and even GOP presidential candidates "" she told CNN. ""They have never named a jihadi group as a hate group.""A conservative blogger she first gained national attention with her group ""Stop the Islamization of America "" and its vocal opposition to an Islamic community center planned near the site of New York's ground zero where the twin towers of the World Trade Center were destroyed by Islamist hijackers on September 11 2001.She said Sunday night that she wasn't expecting such an attack but wasn't surprised that it happened.""This incident shows how much needed our event really was. The freedom of speech is under violent assault here in our nation. The question now before us: Will we stand and defend it or bow to violence thuggery and savagery?""The relevance of the venueBecause of the Sunday night shooting the Garland Independent School District canceled Advanced Placement testing at the Curtis Culwell Center.The center is owned by the school district and rented out for sporting events concerts and other gatherings.In January it rented the facility for an event titled ""Stand with the Prophet "" which was meant to counter Islamophobia after the Charlie Hebdo attack. It drew several hundred attendees and about 200 protesters and went off without incident.Culwell Center Director John Wilborn told The Dallas Morning News that the venue has yet to turn down an event because of content.As for Geller she said she plans on holding similar events.""I will not abridge my freedoms so as not to offend savages "" she said.",87,http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/05/06/germanwings-co-pilot-practiced-descent-on-outbound-flight-before-crash-report/,Investigators say Germanwings co-pilot practiced descent on earlier flight on day of crash,"Germanwings pilot reportedly practiced controlled decentNever autoplay videosFrench air crash investigators said Wednesday that Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz practiced a controlled descent on an earlier flight the day of the crash that killed himself and 149 people.Authorities previously concluded that Lubitz deliberately crashed Germanwings Flight 9525 into the French Alps while flying from Barcelona Spain to Dusseldorf Germany on March 24. Investigators say Lubitz persuaded the flight's more experienced pilot to go to the bathroom before locking him out of the cockpit and sending the plane into a fatal dive. However the French investigative agency BEA now says in an interim report that hours before the crash Lubitz repeatedly sent the same Airbus A320 jet into a descent during the outbound flight from Dusseldorf to Barcelona before bringing it back to cruising altitude. The report added that the pilot appeared to have left the cockpit during the outbound flight was well.Cockpit data shows that Lubitz put the plane into descent mode five times in a four and half-minute period during the Duesseldorf-to-Barcelona leg. The agency said it is continuing to look at the ""systemic failings that may have led to this accident or similar events.""The investigators said their main focus is on ""the current balance between medical confidentiality and flight safety"" and the ""compromises"" made on security after the Sept. 11 attacks in the U.S. notably on cockpit door locking systems.Lufthansa spokesman Helmut Tolksdorf said by phone from Frankfurt that the airline had not yet had time to analyze the new details released by French authorities and planned no immediate comment. Lufthansa is the parent company of Germanwings.Details of the earlier flight in the BEA's report were first described by the German tabloid Bild.Investigators have said that Lubitz 27 suffered from severe depression and had received then torn up a doctor's note saying he was unfit to fly on the day of the crash. Computers removed from Lubitz's apartment in Dusseldorf showed that he had also researched methods of committing suicide in the days leading up to the crash. Last week the Federal Aviation Administration released documents showing that officials questioned Lubitz's mental fitness to fly after he applied for a U.S. pilot's license in 2010.As part of the application he initially submitted a medical form to the FAA asserting that he had no mental disorders. He then resubmitted the form acknowledging he had been treated for severe depression from 2008 to 2009.The FAA initially sent Lubitz a letter warning that his license application could be denied and giving him 30 days to provide a letter from his doctor describing his treatment and his current condition. The license was granted after his doctor described his treatment in letters and said he had recovered.Fox News' Greg Palkot and the Associated Press contributed to this report.",http://us.cnn.com/2015/05/06/europe/france-germanwings-crash-report/index.html,Report: Germanwings crash co-pilot tested 100-foot descent setting,"Story highlightsLubitz rehearsed setting the altitude to 100 feet several times on the previous flight report saysHe did this while the captain was out of the cockpit for less than five minutesLubitz is accused of deliberately crashing the return Germanwings flight into the French Alps(CNN)Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz rehearsed putting his aircraft into a controlled descent on the flight that preceded the crash of his jetliner into the French Alps on March 24 according to an interim report Wednesday by French air accident investigators.The report by the French air accident investigation agency the BEA is based on analysis of the aircraft's flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder.This indicates that on the flight out from Germany to Spain ""Several altitude selections towards 100 ft were recorded during descent on the flight that preceded the accident flight while the co-pilot was alone in the cockpit.""The data recorders indicate the captain had left Lubitz alone on the flight deck for less than five minutes.On the return flight the same morning from Barcelona Spain to Dusseldorf Germany Lubitz is accused of purposely slamming Germanwings Flight 9525 into the French Alps killing all 150 people on board while the captain was locked out of the cockpit.Germanwings plane crashes in France 26 photosEXPAND GALLERYThe co-pilot refused to let the captain re-enter and failed to respond to repeated contacts from air traffic controllers as the plane made its fatal descent.Lubitz suffered from bouts of depression and the incident sparked a global debate over how to monitor the mental health of pilots.Changing altitude settingsThe preliminary BEA report details what happened on board the Airbus A320 on both the outbound and return flights which had the same crew of six.While Lubitz was alone on the flight deck on the outbound flight he was asked to bring the plane down to a lower altitude.At one point ""the selected altitude decreased to 100 ft for three seconds and then increased to the maximum value of 49 000 ft and stabilized again at 35 000 ft "" the report said.Less than two minutes later ""the selected altitude was 100 feet most of the time and changed several times until it stabilized at 25 000 ft.""At this point the captain buzzed to re-enter the cockpit and the flight continued as planned to Barcelona.Because he had already been asked to descend Lubitz's apparent rehearsal of different altitude settings would have gone unnoticed by air traffic controllers since he did not diverge from the flight plan.FAA questioned Germanwings pilot's healthLubitz called unfit to workAnalyst: 'It was a dry run'Asked if there could be any innocent interpretation of the recorded events CNN aviation analyst Miles O'Brien said ""It was a dry run there's no question.""Despite the wildly different altitude selections he said the plane's altitude was going down at a steady rate so the captain and air traffic controllers would not have been alerted to what Lubitz was doing.He was presumably testing the parameters of what the aircraft's systems would allow said O'Brien.""On the Airbus you have a computer system that tends to overrule what the pilot wants to do if it's outside the boundaries of acceptability for the aircraft and safety and so this would be a good way to test where the alarm bells might go off so you could set the selection for the intent which of course we all know what happened "" he said.Violent blows on cockpit doorThe report also provides chilling detail of the final minutes in the cockpit on the return flight before the crash.During the fatal descent French air traffic controllers called the flight crew 11 times on three different frequencies without any response it said. The French military defense system also tried three times to contact the aircraft without any answer.The 34-year-old captain who had left the cockpit after the plane reached its cruising altitude of 38 000 feet buzzed to re-enter the cockpit just over four minutes later.The cockpit voice recorder then picks up what sounds like knocking on the door half a dozen times the sound of a muffled voice asking for the door to be opened and then what sounds like repeated violent blows on the door.The plane crashes into the mountainside about half a minute later.",88,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/03/10/utah-officers-say-mysterious-voice-pushed-them-to-rescue-toddler-trapped-inside/,Utah officers say mysterious voice called them to rescue baby trapped inside car,"Mysterious call for help heard before finding Utah toddlerFour police officers rushing to an overturned car in an icy Utah river say they all heard the same thing: a mysterious female voice calling out Help from inside the vehicle.But the driver of the car was dead and her 18-month-old daughter while still alive couldnt have been the speaker.It was a mystery that continues to haunt the officers and may never be explained.Officer Jared Warner of the Spanish Fork Police Department was one of the first who came to the rescue of tiny Lily Groesback who was strapped in a seat in the back of her mothers car which was precariously hanging upside down in 40-degree water.Weve gotten together and just talk about it and all four of us can swear that we heard somebody inside the car saying Help Warner told Deseret News.More on this...Utah baby girl saved hours after car crash killed her momBut when they flipped over the midsized car they discovered a 25-year-old woman dead in the front seat and Lily unconscious in her car seat.The only people in there were the deceased mother and the child Officer Bryan Dewitt told the paper.Officer Tyler Beddoes said they can't explain it but have no doubt they heard it.""It wasn't just something that was just in our heads.

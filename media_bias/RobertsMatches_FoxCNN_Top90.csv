St. Louis County police say a man who pulled a gun and pointed it at an officer has been killed in Berkeley Missouri.County police spokesman Sgt. Brian Schellman says a Berkeley police officer was conducting a routine business check at a gas station around 11:15 p.m. Wednesday when he saw two men and approached them.Schellman says one of the men pulled a handgun and pointed it at the officer. The officer fired several shots striking and fatally wounding the man. Schellman says that the second person fled and that the deceased man's handgun has been recovered.The St. Louis Post Dispatch reports a group of about 60 people have gathered at the scene.Berkeley is about two miles from Ferguson where a police officer fatally shot 18-year-old Michael Brown in August.,http://us.cnn.com/2014/12/30/justice/ezell-ford-police-shooting-autopsy/index.html?hpt=us_c2,Ezell Ford: Autopsy of unarmed black man shot by police shows key details,"(CNN) -- His name isn't as recognizable as Michael Brown's. But like Brown Ezell Ford was an unarmed black man shot and killed by police in August.Now newly released details of Ford's death could raise a host of new questions.Among the findings: The 25-year-old was shot three times including once in the back. And that wound was surrounded by a muzzle imprint Ford's autopsy report shows.But ""there is nothing in the coroner's report that is inconsistent with the statements given to us by the officers "" Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said.Ford was shot by Los Angeles police on August 11 -- two days after Brown was killed.The Los Angeles County coroner's office released the autopsy Monday after the Los Angeles police removed its security hold on it.The LAPD had put an administrative hold on Ford's autopsy because the department said it wanted witnesses to come forward before the autopsy's release.What happened?The circumstances leading up to Ford's death aren't exactly clear.According to one of the officers involved he and Ford got into a ""violent struggle "" Beck said.Ford ended up on top of the officer with Ford in control of the officer's pistol the police chief said.""The officer drew his backup gun and reached over Mr. Ford's back and shot Mr. Ford in very close proximity -- possibly probably the cause of the muzzle imprint that's mentioned in the coroner's report "" Beck said.Ford's family has said he was mentally ill and unarmed.The police chief said the investigation is far from over.""We continue to seek the public's assistance. Any information regarding this incident will help us complete this picture "" Beck said.He said police have not been able to reach any civilian witnesses who actually saw the shooting.""We still are searching for witnesses. We still are looking for other versions of events.""He said the district attorney will make the final determination about whether the shooting met legal standards.Before the autopsy's release a Los Angeles community leader wondered how the shooting could be justified.""How do you explain when you have this level of deadly force against those that are not even accused of committing a crime and are not even armed?"" asked Earl Ofari Hutchinson of the Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable.The two officers involved have been assigned to non-field duties as the investigation continues."3,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2014/12/25/protesters-rally-for-2nd-night-in-missouri-after-officer-fatally-shoots-armed/,Protesters rally for second night after shooting near Ferguson,"Protests for second night after shooting near FergusonNever autoplay videosBERKELEY Mo.  Demonstrators took to the streets for a second night after a white police officer in Berkeley Missouri killed a black 18-year-old who police said pointed a gun at him.Dozens of protesters held a vigil late Wednesday at the gas station in the St. Louis suburb where Antonio Martin was shot and they briefly blocked traffic on Interstate 170 during a march before returning to the station. Berkeley Police Chief Frank McCall told KMOV-TV that six to eight people were arrested.Later about 75 people staged a peaceful protest early Christmas morning outside of a nearby church according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Police in riot gear were present.The actions were calmer than a night before when a crowd of about 300 people gathered at the gas station throwing rocks and bricks in a scene reminiscent of the sometimes-violent protests that followed the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown in nearby Ferguson.Unlike in the death of Brown who was unarmed and whose shooting was not captured on video Berkeley Mayor Theodore Hoskins said Wednesday that surveillance footage appeared to show Martin pulling a gun on the unidentified 34-year-old officer who questioned him and another man about a theft at a convenience store.Hoskins urged calm saying ""You couldn't even compare this with Ferguson or the Garner case in New York "" a reference to the chokehold death of Eric Garner another black man whose death was caused by a white police officer.Hoskins who is black also noted that unlike in Ferguson -- where a mostly white police force serves a mostly black community -- more than half of the officers in his city of 9 000 are black including top command staff.State Sen. Maria Chappelle-Nadal a Democrat who has been critical of how police handled the Brown case also said the Martin shooting was far different than Brown's noting that Martin pointed a weapon at the officer.""That officer not only has an obligation to protect the community but he also has a responsibility to protect himself "" said the senator who is black. ""Because of the video it is more than apparent that his life was in jeopardy.""But Taurean Russell co-founder of Hands Up United asked if police had any reason to question Martin in the first place. Mistrust of police remains high among blacks many of whom are weary of harassment said Russell who is black.St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar did not provide more details Wednesday about the theft Martin was being asked about. He said Martin pulled a loaded 9mm handgun and the officer fired three shots while stumbling backward. One hit Martin who didn't fire his own gun. He died at the scene.""I don't know why the guy didn't get a shot off whether his gun jammed or he couldn't get the safety off "" said attorney Brian Millikan who is representing the officer. He said that the officer was lucky to be alive and certain he had no choice but to use lethal force.Police throughout the country have been on alert since two New York officers were gunned down in an ambush last weekend by a man who had made threatening posts online about killing police. He later killed himself.St. Louis County police and the city of Berkeley are investigating the shooting of Martin which Belmar called a tragedy for both Martin's family and the officer who has been on the force for six years.""He will carry the weight of this for the rest of his life certainly for the rest of his career "" Belmar said of the officer. ""There are no winners here.""The officer wasn't wearing his body camera and his cruiser's dashboard camera was not activated because the car's emergency lights were not on Belmar said.Police released surveillance video clips from three different angles. The men can be seen leaving the store as a patrol car drives up. The officer gets out and speaks with them.About 90 seconds later one appears to raise his arm though it's difficult to see what he's holding because they were several feet from the camera. Belmar said it was a 9mm handgun with one round in the chamber and five more in the magazine.Police were searching Wednesday for the other man who ran away.Belmar said Martin had a criminal record that included three assault charges plus charges of armed robbery armed criminal action and unlawful use of a weapon.Phone messages left for his parents were not returned. His mother Toni Martin-Green told the Post-Dispatch that Antonio was the oldest of four children.""He's like any other kid who had dreams or hopes "" she said. ""We loved being around him. He'd push a smile out of you.""His was the third fatal shooting of a young black man by a white police officer in the St. Louis area since Brown was killed by Ferguson officer Darren Wilson on Aug. 9. Kajieme Powell 25 was killed Aug. 19 after approaching St. Louis officers with a knife. Vonderrit Myers 18 was fatally shot on Oct. 8 after allegedly shooting at a St. Louis officer.Each killing has led to protests as did a grand jury's decision last month not to charge Wilson in Brown's death.",http://us.cnn.com/2015/03/13/us/ferguson-protests/index.html,Ferguson protests: Time and rain cool tempers; hunt on for shooting suspects,"Story highlightsState troopers and county police will take over protest securityInvestigators identify two people they want to question; one might be the shooter(CNN)Prayers went up the rain came down and tensions cooled overnight in Ferguson Missouri.It was a far cry from 24 hours earlier when tempers flared and two police officers took bullets in the St. Louis suburb.Authorities changed tactics in the aftermath of the shootings.St. Louis County Police said it had assumed ""command of the security detail regarding protests "" together with the Missouri State Highway Patrol.Ferguson Police remain responsible for ""routine policing services"" in the city.Investigators believe they have identified two people they want to question in the shooting and one of them might be the shooter a law enforcement official said. Police are also trying to find anyone who may have helped the shooter get away.Late night with the PresidentPresident Barack Obama who appeared on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live"" Thursday night condemned the attack on the officers but said it shouldn't detract from the main issue.""What had been happening in Ferguson was oppressive and objectionable and was worthy of protest but there was no excuse for criminal acts "" he said.""They're criminals they need to be arrested and then what we need to do is to make sure that like-minded good-spirited people on both sides -- law enforcement who have terrifically tough job and people who understandably don't want to be harassed just because of their race -- that we're able to work together to come up with some good answers.""Prayer vigilA call for calm came at a Thursday night prayer vigil. Clergy and others gathered.""Our hearts go out to the families of the injured officers "" a statement from vigil organizers said. ""Our prayers are with these officers their families and every victim of violence in our streets.""Although the streets were calm the call for action remained the same.""For over 200 days hundreds of thousands of people across the country have taken to the streets to demand change.

My heart knew by then that my fianc was on that flight.Siaun was heading to Singapore to vacation with his family for the last time as a bachelor. Sidharta took a later flight from Surabaya to Singapore. She spoke to a horde of reporters at the Singapore Changi International Airport.We have to stay positive and hope that they (loved ones) could be found soon she said.AirAsia said there are 155 passengers on board138 adults 16 children and one infant. Also on board are two pilots and five crew members.The Associated Press said dozens of relatives of people aboard the plane gathered in a room at the Surabaya airport to await word about their loved ones.Sky News said a British businessman and his two-year-old daughter are believed to be on the flight. Most on board are from Indonesia with three from South Korea and one each from Singapore Malaysia France and the United Kingdom.Indonesia and Singapore have launched a search and rescue operation after the flight was reported missing.Indonesian officials tell Fox News that the air search has been suspended for the night due to poor weather and will resume Monday morning local time.Achmad Toha told The Associated Press that the planes involved in the search returned to their base Sunday evening but that some ships were still in the area where the plane lost contact with air traffic control. The air search was set to resume at 6 a.m. Monday.Flight 8501 was scheduled to make a relatively short early-morning flight from Surabaya Indonesia to Singapore but lost contact with Jakarta air traffic control at 6:24 a.m. local time (6:24 p.m. Eastern Time Saturday) approximately an hour before it was due to land.Eleven minutes earlier according to Djoko Murjatmodjo Indonesia's acting director general of transportation the pilot had ""asked to hinder cloud by turning left and go higher to 34 000 feet."" Murjatmodjo said that there was no distress signal from the plane. AirAsia Indonesia had earlier confirmed that the pilot had asked to change course due to bad weather in the area.""We hope we can find the location of the plane as soon as possible and we hope that God will give us guidance to find it "" Murjatmodjo told reporters. ""We don't dare to presume what has happened except that it has lost contact.Flight 8501 was last seen on radar at 6:16 a.m. and a minute later was no longer there he added.""This is my worst nightmare "" AirAsia founder Tony Fernandes said in a tweet. Earlier Fernandes the face of the company and an active Twitter user sent out a tweet that said: ""Thank you for all your thoughts and prays[sic]. We must stay strong.""Sunardi a weather forecaster at the Indonesia's Meteorology and Geophysics Agency who uses only one name told the Associated Press that dense storm clouds were detected up to 44 000 feet in the same area at the time the plane was reported to have lost contact.""There could have been turbulence lightning and vertical as well as horizontal strong winds within such clouds "" he said.AirAsia said the single-aisle Airbus A320-200 had an Indonesian captain and a French co-pilot. The airline's statement added that the plane's captain had a total of 6 100 flying hours while the first officer had flown 2 275 hours.Flightradar24 a flight tracking website said the plane was delivered in September 2008 which would make it six years old. It said the plane was flying at 32 000 feet the regular cruising altitude for most jetliners when the signal from the plane was lost. AirAsia said that the plane had undergone its last scheduled maintenance on Nov. 16.Murjatmodjo the Indonesian official said the plane is believed to have vanished somewhere over the Java Sea between Tanjung Pandan on Belitung island and Pontianak on Indonesia's part of Kalimantan island.Transport Minister Ignasius Jonan told reporters in Surabaya that the position was believed to be near the coast line. He said search and rescue efforts now involved the Indonesian army the national Search and Rescue Agency as well as Singapore and Malaysia. The Search and Rescue Agency's operation chief Maj. Gen. Tatang Zaenudin said 200 rescuers had been deployed to the east side of Belitung island.Air Force spokesman Hadi Tjahjanto said three aircraft including a surveillance plane had been dispatched to the area. The Singapore air force and the navy also were searching with two C-130 planes.The Singapore aviation authority said it was informed about the missing plane by Jakarta ground control about half an hour after the contact was lost.Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak expressed solidarity with AirAsia. In a tweet he said: ""Very sad to hear that AirAsia Indonesia QZ8501 is missing. My thoughts are with the families. Malaysia stands ready to help.""White House spokesman Eric Schultz said in a statement that President Obama had briefed about the missing flight and officials would continue to monitor the situation.According to the website FlightAware.com Flight QZ8501 was scheduled to depart from Juanda International Airport near Surabaya on the Indonesian island of East Java at 5:30 a.m. local time with arrival in Singapore scheduled for 8:20 a.m. Singapore time (7:20 p.m. Eastern Time Saturday). It had last flown the route on Dec. 26.The Airbus A320 is a workhorse of modern aviation. Similar to the Boeing 737 it is used to connect cities anywhere from one to five hours apart. There are currently 3 606 A320s in operation worldwide according to Airbus. The A320 family of jets which includes A319 and A321 has a very good safety record with just 0.14 fatal accidents per million takeoffs according to a safety study published by Boeing in August.AirAsia which has a presence in several Southeast Asian countries has never lost a plane before. AirAsia Malaysia owns 49 percent of the Indonesian subsidiary. The airline typically flies short routes of just a few hours connecting large cities of Southeast Asia. However recently it has tried to expand into long-distance flying through its sister airline AirAsia X.Earlier this year national carrier Malaysia Airlines lost two planes. Flight MH370 vanished on March 8 with 239 passengers and crew on board.

That brings the total number of victims now found to 69.Indonesian divers tried Saturday to float the wreckage using a giant balloon said Supriyadi.They made several descents to the fuselage to attach the balloon weighing around 10 tons to the fuselage using ropes and belts and to inflate it. But the operation hit a snag when a belt broke as the team tried to bring the wreckage up to the surface.Divers successfully carried out the same procedure with the tail section of the aircraft earlier this month.The aircraft went down on December 28 as it flew from the Indonesian city of Surabaya toward Singapore with 162 people on board.It's believed many of the remaining bodies could be in the wreckage of the fuselage which searchers located 10 days ago at the bottom of the sea.Efforts to examine and get inside the wreckage have been hindered by high waves and strong currents.AirAsia Flight 8501 climbed quickly then stalled 01:58PLAY VIDEOA top Indonesian official said Tuesday that the aircraft had climbed rapidly and then stalled shortly before it crashed.Experts have speculated from the outset that storms might have played a role in the plane crash.Amid increasingly bad weather one of the pilots had requested to deviate from the plane's planned route AirAsia has said.The analysis of the data recorders for the preliminary report on the crash is now 90% complete according to National Transportation Safety Committee investigator Nurcahyo Utomo.Utomo an expert in ""black box"" analysis said he had already listened to the pilot and co-pilot's conversation from the cockpit voice recorder.

Minutes later the jet was gone from the radar without issuing a distress signal.The suspected crash caps an astonishingly tragic year for air travel in Southeast Asia and Malaysia in particular. Malaysia-based AirAsia's loss comes on top of the still-unsolved disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in March with 239 people aboard and the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 in July over Ukraine which killed all 298 passengers and crew.Nearly all the passengers and crew are Indonesians who are frequent visitors to Singapore particularly on holidays.Ifan Joko 54 said that despite the tragic news he is still hoping for a miracle.

Most of the people on board the flight remain missing and search teams are still looking for the main wreckage of the plane.Efforts are being concentrated in a zone covering 1 575 square nautical miles (5 400 square kilometers) that officials believe is the ""most probable area"" to find the remains of the aircraft.But on Friday waves in the Java Sea as high as four meters (13 feet) were making it hard for divers search underwater.The weather is ""the biggest obstacle "" said Bambang Hermanu chief of police in Indonesia's Central Kalimantan province where much of the search operation is based.Here's more key information about where things stand on Flight QZ8501:The flightWhat we know: The aircraft took off early Sunday from Surabaya Indonesia bound for Singapore. Roughly 35 minutes into the flight the pilot asked air traffic control for permission to turn left and climb to a higher altitude to avoid bad weather. Minutes later the plane disappeared from air traffic control's radar.What we don't know: What happened on board after contact with the plane was lost. No distress call was received. Indonesian aviation authorities have suggested that the plane ascended despite permission being denied because of traffic.Some experts have speculated that the aircraft might have experienced an aerodynamic stall because of a lack of speed or from flying at too sharp an angle to get enough lift. Analysts have also suggested that the pilots might not have been getting information from onboard systems about the plane's position or that rain or hail from thunderstorms in the area could have damaged the engines.Until the main wreckage of the plane is found along with the flight recorders experts have little evidence to support their theories.How can a modern airliner vanish?The searchWhat we know: Search teams found debris and some bodies in the water Tuesday 100 to 200 kilometers (about 60 to 120 miles) from the aircraft's last known location over the Java Sea Indonesia's search and rescue agency said. Thirty bodies have so far been recovered from the sea Indonesian officials said Friday.Early Friday what appears to be a piece of the fuselage was found Singapore's Defense Ministry said. It resembles a window panel.The USS Sampson the U.S. Navy ship that is helping with the search recovered two bodies Thursday the U.S. Seventh Fleet said Friday. Indonesia is leading the international search effort with assistance from a range of countries including Malaysia Singapore and the United States.What we don't know: The exact location of the body of the aircraft. An Indonesian search official told CNN on Wednesday that he thought sonar equipment had detected wreckage from Flight 8501 at the bottom of the Java Sea. But the country's search and rescue chief said the plane hadn't been found yet. Bad weather has hindered the search operation.The ones who missed the flightThe people on boardWhat we know: The plane was carrying 155 passengers and seven crew members. The overwhelming majority of those on board were Indonesians. There were also citizens of Britain France Malaysia Singapore and South Korea. Details are emerging about some of the people on the flight recounted by family members and friends.What we don't know: When the missing passengers and crew members will be recovered. Indonesian authorities have identified four of the recovered bodies so far. The first victim they identified an Indonesian woman named Hayati Lutfiah Hamid was buried Thursday. Many family members are waiting in Surabaya for news about their loved ones.Who was aboard AirAsia Flight QZ8501?The investigationWhat we know: The key to understanding what happened may be in the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder commonly known as black boxes. The black boxes which are actually orange are in the tail of Airbus 320-200s. If recovered they will be taken to a lab in Jakarta Indonesia to be analyzed said Tatang Kurniadi head of Indonesia's National Committee for Transportation Safety. The batteries powering the ""pingers"" that send acoustic signals have only about 25 days of power left he said.What we don't know: Where the plane's remains might have been taken by the elements. Investigators will need to use information gleaned from the flight recorders and clues from the wreckage.""The more bits I can put into my mosaic the better my picture will be "" aviation safety expert Michael Barr said. ""The better the picture the better I can come up with an understanding of what happened."" But the conditions at sea make that work much more difficult than on land. ""In the water you are working with currents and winds and so the pieces won't be where they had the initial impact "" he said.What happens next?The plane and the pilotsWhat we know: The 6-year-old Airbus A320-200 operated by AirAsia's Indonesian affiliate had accumulated around 23 000 flight hours in about 13 600 flights according to Airbus. The plane's last scheduled maintenance was on November 16.Flight 8501's veteran captain Iriyanto 53 had 20 537 flying hours 6 100 of them with AirAsia on the Airbus A320 the airline said. The first officer Remi Emmanuel Plesel 46 had 2 275 flying hours a reasonable amount for his position.What we don't know: Whether technical problems human error or other issues were involved in the crash. According to information from the Aviation Safety Network accident database there have been 54 incidents involving the A320.""In the A320 family accidents and incidents range from fan-cowl detachment landing gear collapse bird strikes right through to hull losses through pilot error "" said Kane Ray an analyst with the International Bureau of Aviation a global aviation consulting group.

It ""does not appear that the police officer initiated"" the incident he said.Hoskins promised a thorough investigation.""I will not tolerate brutality of any policeman on our citizens "" Hoskins told CNN.

The station showed Martin's tearful mother Toni Martin saying her son was ""trying to get his life back together.""Police: Officer was investigating alleged theftCounty Police Chief Jon Belmar said the shooting was tragic but stressed the teen pointed a gun ""straight out"" at the officer who fired in self-defense.""I understand the emotions ... but I think we need to understand the context of what happens ... with these types of situations "" Belmar whose department is investigating the shooting told reporters.Belmar said the officer a 34-year-old six-year Berkeley police veteran was responding to a report of a theft when he pulled into the parking lot of a Mobil gas station in Berkeley shortly before 11:15 p.m.He left his cruiser and talked to two men in the lot. Eventually as the officer stood by the driver's side tire of his cruiser one of the men backed away from the cruiser's passenger side headlight then stepped forward again pointing a gun at the officer Belmar said.The officer whom police did not name lost balance and fell as he moved back in reaction but managed to fire what investigators believe were three shots hitting the gunman at least once Belmar said.The slain teen is not believed to have fired his weapon a loaded 9 mm handgun that police recovered at the scene Belmar said. Police later released a photo of the weapon.Meanwhile there was a shooting in St. Louis on Wednesday. CNN affiliate KMOV reported one person was shot to death and three were in critical condition. No other details were immediately available.Surveillance video but body camera wasn't wornIn the Martin case video released by authorities showed a second man nearby who fled when the shooting occurred. Authorities are looking to interview him.Martin's father Jerome Green said his son had indicated he was going out to meet his girlfriend and had not mentioned any other person who might be with them.""He was supposed to come home "" Green said. ""We're getting ready for the holiday; everyone wanted to see him. My grandmother hadn't seen him for a while.""The officer involved was given a body camera before he left for patrol but he wasn't wearing it during the shooting possibly because he was distracted when a supervisor gave it to him earlier Tuesday Belmar said.Hoskins said this didn't bother him in part because the city with three cameras for its 31 officers had just started training officers to use them.The cruiser's dashboard camera also wasn't recording because the car's emergency lights hadn't been activated Belmar said. The officer will be placed on administrative leave until the investigation is completed.Green said Martin lived with his parents brother and sister.Protest scuffleProtesters late Tuesday and early Wednesday gathered around an ethnically diverse group of dozens of police officers who stood between them and the scene. People in the crowd screamed at police. Others spoke more calmly.What looked like a firework exploded near a gas pump scattering people and temporarily filling the area with thick white smoke video from CNN affiliate KMOV showed.Four people were arrested on suspicion of assaulting officers Belmar said. One police officer was sent to an emergency room after injuring himself while trying to get away from the firework Belmar said.Another officer was treated at a hospital after being hit in the head with a rock or a brick Belmar said.St. Louis Post-Dispatch photographer David Carson said some of the protesters damaged police cars. CNN showed images of one squad car with a large dent in its side.KMOV video showed a white plume rising at another location down the street. Belmar said someone had tried to set a fire at a nearby store but someone extinguished it.Before sunup protesters thinned out and those remaining stood calmly behind police tape.Tuesday's incident came about a month after a St. Louis County grand jury declined to indict Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson for fatally shooting Michael Brown on August 9.Authorities said Brown who was black wasn't armed at the time but that he tried to take Wilson's gun while the officer was in his vehicle during an encounter in Ferguson. Some witness accounts said Wilson left his car and eventually fired while Brown 18 had his hands up in surrender but others disputed this. Police said Wilson fired in self-defense as Brown charged him.Berkeley is a city of about 8 000 people flanked by St. Louis International Airport to the west and Ferguson to the east."11,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/01/02/2-west-virginia-officers-injured-in-highway-shootout-involving-2-gunmen-1/,Two West Virginia officers injured in shootout with gunmen carrying bodies in vehicle trunk,Police officers wounded in highway shootoutNever autoplay videosAuthorities in West Virginia say that two police officers were injured Thursday in a shootout with two suspects who were transporting the bodies of an elderly North Carolina couple. The two Lewisburg officers pulled over an SUV around 4 p.m. Thursday on a highway outside of the city Lt. Michael Baylous of the West Virginia State Police said in a press release. The SUV had a North Carolina license plate that showed it had been stolen. During the stop a truck pulled over in the area.As the officers were conducting the stop the driver of the truck shot at them with a handgun wounding both officers Baylous said. One officer returned fire wounding the suspect in the leg.Baylous said the driver of the SUV fled the scene and hid but later turned himself in without incident.

(AP)BOSTON  His accusers brandish a confession scribbled inside a boat during an intensive manhunt and a video they say shows him placing a backpack with a bomb a few feet from a little boy who died when it exploded seconds later.His defenders bank on the story of a difficult childhood in a former Soviet republic and his radicalization at the hands of an influential older brother who could have pressured him into participating in the deadly attack.Jury selection for the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev accused in the Boston Marathon attacks begins Monday. Those chosen from a pool of about 1 200 will decide whether Tsarnaev planned and carried out the twin bombings that killed three people and injured more than 260 near the finish line of the race on April 15 2013. If they find him guilty they will decide whether he should be put to death.It's perhaps the most closely watched federal death penalty case since Timothy McVeigh was convicted and executed for the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. Tsarnaev's lawyers tried in vain for months to get the trial moved arguing the Boston jury pool was tainted because of the number of locals with connections to the race and drawing parallels to the McVeigh case which was moved to Denver for similar reasons. But U.S. District Judge George O'Toole Jr. has been unmoved.Jury selection alone is expected to take several weeks because of extensive media coverage and the thousands of runners spectators and others in the area personally affected by the bombings. The process also could be slowed if potential jurors express objections to the death penalty.Some legal observers say Tsarnaev's lawyers facing powerful evidence against him will probably focus their energies on the penalty phase when they could present mitigating evidence to spare his life. He has a strong team behind him. Attorney Judy Clarke touts a strong record of helping her high-profile clients avoid the death penalty including Ted Kaczynski the Unabomber; Olympic Park bomber Eric Rudolph; and Jared Loughner who killed six people and wounded former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords.Tsarnaev's lawyers are likely to narrow in on motive and any pressure exerted on him said Dan Collins a former assistant U.S. attorney in Chicago who has investigated U.S. ties to terrorism.""I think his mitigation will be in part paying close attention to what his explanation is and what circumstances beyond his control ... caused him to do this "" Collins said.Prosecutors say 21-year-old Dzhokhar and his brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev ethnic Chechens who had lived in the United States for about a decade carried out the bombings as retaliation for U.S. actions in Muslim countries. They are also accused of killing Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier. Tamerlan 26 died after a firefight with police several days after the bombings.Dzhokhar was captured later that day wounded and bloodied hiding inside a boat stored in a suburban yard. Prosecutors said he described a motive in a note written in the boat: ""The U.S. Government is killing our innocent civilians"" and ""We Muslims are one body you hurt one you hurt us all.""Tsarnaev's lawyers may lay the groundwork for some kind of mental health explanation said Christopher Dearborn a professor at Suffolk University Law School. That could include any persecution his family might have suffered as ethnic minorities in Kyrgyzstan where the brothers spent most of their lives before moving to the U.S. with their parents and two sisters.""I think the real value in that may be to start to try to generate even a little bit of empathy around this and humanize the kid a little bit hopefully enough to save a life "" Dearborn said.Alice LoCicero a Cambridge psychologist and terrorism expert who wrote a book ""Why 'Good Kids' Turn Into Deadly Terrorists: Deconstructing the Accused Boston Marathon Bombers and Others Like Them "" said she believes Dzhokhar Tsarnaev may have been susceptible to the influence of his brother and others in part because he had lost structure in the year before the bombings.Among those life changes: Dzhokhar had left the family's Cambridge home to attend the University of Massachusetts in Dartmouth his parents moved to the volatile Dagestan region of Russia and the family was having financial troubles. Authorities believe Tamerlan became radicalized in the last few years of his life including during a six-month trip to Dagestan and Chechnya in 2012.Prosecutors however say Dzhokhar showed signs before the bombings even to his closest friends that he was becoming radicalized.At least one of three college friends convicted of lying or impeding the investigation is expected to testify against him. An additional friend who pleaded guilty to possessing a gun used to kill a police officer during the manhunt is also expected to testify for the prosecution.Other prosecution witnesses are expected to include people hurt in the bombings as well as police officers who helped in the aftermath.Dzhokhar's defense team has been pushing to show that he may have been intimidated by his brother. Prosecutors revealed in a court filing that Ibragim Todashev a friend of Tamerlan's said Tamerlan participated in a grisly triple slaying in Waltham a Boston suburb in 2011.The trial expected to last several months is likely to draw spectators injured in the bombings as well as supporters of Tsarnaev who have demonstrated outside the courthouse during pretrial hearings. Tsarnaev's own lawyers have asked that the demonstrators be kept at arm's length.Heather Abbott a Rhode Island woman who lost part of her left leg in the bombings is one of several victims who plan to attend at least part of the trial. She said she hopes to gain some understanding of the motive.""I don't see it as something that will get me past the horror of that day "" she said. ""It's something that I will always live with.""",http://us.cnn.com/2015/03/10/us/tsarnaev-tweets-writings/index.html,Tsarnaev's 'manifesto': OK to kill civilians,"Story highlightsJurors see Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's writings on boat where he hidProsecutor calls it his ""manifesto"" and shows his intent to harmTsarnaev: ""We Muslims are one body you hurt one you hurt us all""Boston (CNN)Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's own words may determine whether he lives or dies even if he never speaks a word at his trial.The admitted Boston Marathon bomber has sat in silence as people who lost limbs sobbed or glared at him from the witness stand. He slouched in his chair as jurors watched videos of him both before and after two nail-packed pressure cooker bombs exploded killing three people claiming 17 limbs and hurting more than 260 others.He didn't utter a peep as his tweets and words he had scribbled on the side of a pleasure boat flashed up on a big screen and were quoted in court.At issue: Was Tsarnaev a terrorist looking to punish the United States for policies he believed were harmful to Muslims? Or was he a goofball stoner who simply followed the lead of his older more radical brother?The defense team tried to portray Tsarnaev as a confused college kid who like countless others watches Comedy Central and cracks crass jokes. ""I wanna study a broad or two "" he posted on his Twitter account as @J_tsar. He jokes about not seeing commercials featuring the Trix rabbit and about ""whale watching"" outside a McDonald's fast-food restaurant.Miriam Conrad a member of his defense team tried Tuesday to apply a more benign spin on tweets the government contends show him as a would-be jihadist eager for martyrdom and a free pass to paradise.His brother was dead and police knew who he was; they were scouring the Boston suburb of Watertown for Tsarnaev when he slipped under a tarp and climbed aboard the Slip Away II a fishing boat dry-docked in a Watertown backyard. He hid for hours before being discovered.Boston Marathon bombing evidence photos 9 photosEXPAND GALLERYBleeding he picked up a pencil and wrote what Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb called his ""manifesto.""Tsarnaev wrote he was jealous that his brother Tamerlan had achieved paradise by dying like a holy warrior; he was killed the night before during a gunbattle with police. The indictment against him says Tsarnaev helped in his brother's demise by running him over and dragging him along the road as he tried to run down police.About the bombings Tsarnaev wrote on the boat that he didn't enjoy killing innocent civilians but that circumstances excused it.""The US Government is killing our innocent civilians but most of you already know that "" he wrote. ""Know you are fighting men who look into the barrel of your gun and see heaven now how can you compete with that. We are promised victory and we will surely get it.""Streaks of blood cover portions of his message. More than a dozen bullet holes obliterate parts of words. So ended one of the biggest manhunts in U.S. history.While in the boat he wrote that he couldn't stand to see the U.S. government ""go unpunished"" for killing Muslims. ""We Muslims are one body you hurt one you hurt us all.""He ended with: ""Now I don't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in Islam but due to said "" -- the word was lost to a bullet hole -- ""it is allowed.""Tsarnaev's connections: Who's whoJudge George O'Toole viewed the boat Tuesday afternoon so he could rule on a defense request to show the entire boat ""in context"" to the jury. He turned down requests by the media to accompany him.The defense said the government only presented about 45 tweets out of about 1 100. Many were benign about girls cars and food as well as sleeping and disliking studying the defense argued.On Monday FBI agent Steven Kimball testified about two Twitter accounts used by Tsarnaev. One account shows he tweeted on the day of the April 15 2013 bombing:Ain't no love in the heart of the city stay safe people Jahar (@J_tsar) April 16 2013""Ain't no love in the heart of the city stay safe people""His last tweet was on April 17. He sent it while on the run:I'm a stress free kind of guy Jahar (@J_tsar) April 17 2013""I'm a stress free kind of guy""His other account carried seven tweets including this:strive to be a better muslim be greedy with your time devote most of it to the Almighty for it is his satisfaction that you need #islam Ghuraba (@Al_firdausiA) March 11 2013""strive to be a better muslim be greedy with your time devote most of it to the Almighty for it is his satisfaction that you need #islam""Photos: Manhunt for Boston bombers 45 photosEXPAND GALLERYThe jury also has now seen Tsarnaev in videos trailing his brother onto Boylston Street. Both carried heavy backpacks. He paused for four minutes standing next to a tree in front of the Forum restaurant. In front of him stood a line of children who were leaning over the barricade and watching the race. He put his backpack down at his feet and made a phone call.Timeline of the bombings manhunt and aftermathWhen his brother's bomb went off a block away heads swiveled in surprise in the direction of the noise. And there was Tsarnaev walking through the crowd looking back over his shoulder as his own bomb went off 12 seconds later. Martin Richard an 8-year-old standing in the line of kids took the full brunt of the blast which tore him apart.The bombs went off at 2:49 and 2:50 p.m. about the same time as he exchanged phone calls with his brother. The next video showed Tsarnaev in the crowd running. Other videos show him carrying on as usual: buying milk and swiping his card at his college gym. But FBI agents were already in pursuit collecting store security videos and looking for somebody suspicious in the marathon crowd.By Wednesday night authorities had a good idea who they were looking for. By Thursday night his photo had been released to the public.

Cold weather is expected to stay around for a few days. (AP Photo/Sheboygan Press Media Gary C. Klein) (The Associated Press)Dangerously cold air has sent temperatures plummeting into the single digits around the U.S. with wind chills driving them even lower. Throw in the snow some areas are getting and you've got a bone chilling mix that may also be super messy.The result?School delays and cancellations a fatal car pileup and worries about the homeless.Here's a look at what's happening:___A PILEUP IN WHITEOUT CONDITIONSAn 18-vehicle pileup that happened in whiteout conditions on a western Pennsylvania interstate has left two people dead and nearly two dozen injured.Nine trucks several of them tractor-trailers and nine cars were involved in the crash Wednesday afternoon on Interstate 80 in Clarion Township state police said. At least one of the trucks was carrying hazardous material but no leaks were found.None of the injuries was thought to be life-threatening but three of the approximately 20 people taken to the hospital appeared to have serious injuries. The others were treated for everything from bumps to broken bones.___DELAYING AND CANCELING SCHOOLSchool districts from the South to the Northeast are delaying the start of classes or canceling school altogether.Wind-chill readings below zero were forecast in such places as Alabama and Asheville North Carolina along with a chunk of the Midwest and the Plains. Some areas also are seeing anywhere from a few inches to a foot of snow.In northwest Georgia schools in Catoosa County will have a two-hour delayed start on Thursday because of temperatures expected to top out at 27 degrees and dip as low as minus 2 degrees with wind chills. School officials have urged students to wait for buses inside or in warm cars with parents and have said bus drivers would make individual stops at students' homes and blow their horns if necessary.Among the many cities modifying school schedules is Detroit where it was 8 degrees on Wednesday. At least Detroit-area 15 area districts and schools canceled classes Thursday.___STAYING WARM REACHING OUT TO THE HOMELESSMany cities experiencing cold weather have opened warming stations for residents lacking heat. But extra care is being taken to protect the homeless.In New Jersey some officials have empowered law enforcement to move homeless people off the streets and into shelters.Blankets were being given out at some of the 15 small tent cities around Huntsville Alabama. Workers from a nonprofit organization there encouraged residents of the encampments to come inside. Some people planned to stay at a church that was opening as a shelter.""We've got snow flurries as the temperatures continue to drop so they're coming in "" said Clete Wetli executive director of First Stop Inc. which provides transportation mental health counseling and other services to the homeless. ""The last thing we want is for someone to get hypothermia or die of frostbite.""Officials in Ohio and Georgia warned residents never to use their kitchen ovens or stoves to heat their homes. It could prove deadly.___THERE IS A BRIGHT SIDETemperatures were expected to drop to zero or below in southern New England and to 7 above in New York City with wind chills getting into the minus-20s in some places. But little or no snow is forecast for most of the Northeast.Around this time last year parts of the region were digging out from 2 feet of snow accompanied by brutal polar air.In fact this season's snowfall totals are way down from last year one of the snowiest seasons on record.Last year Philadelphia New York and Boston all got around 5 feet of snow from December through February or about 112 to 212 feet more than normal. This year they've seen only a few inches of snow since Dec. 1.But then there's western New York. The Buffalo area got slammed with more than 7 feet of snow in November and saw another foot on Tuesday. Thursday night and Friday could bring another 5 inches to 10 inches weather forecasters say.___MEANWHILE IN ARIZONA...Phoenix posted a record high temperature of 80 degrees on Wednesday.

But her early and practically all-encompassing effort also presents the potential liability that she will sail through the primary season largely untested for the bare-knuckled general election. And it could deny Democrats the chance to define themselves to Americans strategists say.It's not good for a party because the Democratic Party needs a real debate about what it's for who it's for what it's about and where we'll take the country says Dennis Kucinich a former Democratic congressman presidential candidate and a Fox News contributor.The 67-year-old Clinton plans to make an official announcement in early 2015 leaving some doubt about whether she will indeed run. But her frontrunner status is unquestionable.She has roughly 62 percent of the likely vote and leads all potential Democratic challengers by a numbing 49.5 percentage points.And those numbers combined with an ambitious public-speaking schedule and the fundraising and cheerleading group Ready for Hillary are making it difficult for potential primary challengers to raise money.In addition Clintons most formidable likely primary challenger now Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren insists shes not running leaving the Democratic field so wide open that 73-year-old Bernie Sanders an independent and junior senator from Vermont is now fourth behind Clinton Warren and Vice President Biden according an averaging of polls by RealClearPolitics.com I think you miss the chance to vet ideals says Richard Fowler a Democrat and host of the progressive-leaning Richard Fowler Talk Show. I think that's what elections are about. Elections are about ideals and how ideals ... would then turn into policy that will then turn into how we govern.Clinton a former first lady secretary of State and New York senator hasnt been in a campaign-style debate since 2008 when she lost the Democratic presidential primary to President Obama then a freshman Illinois senator.Still a relatively easy 2016 primary if Clinton indeed runs would likely save her from the pummeling she took last time.Youre likeable enough Hillary Obama said on stage to Clinton who was the early Democratic frontrunner in that race too.Among the tough questions she will likely face and needs to answer well include what she knew about security at the U.S. outpost in Benghazi Libya in which four Americans were killed in a 2012 terror attack.Clinton who is worthy millions of dollars also will likely have to make a strong case that she will champion the countrys poor and working class after saying on her 2014 book tour: We came out of the White House not only dead broke but in debt.Hillary Clinton I think has proven that when you're off the trail for a while you come back rusty said Larry Sabato director of the University of Virginias Center for Politics.

""They don't know who Elizabeth Warren is. I tell them they need to get involved they are middle class too and they need representation.""It is the term ""middle class"" that is repeated time and time again when talking to Warren supporters: she understands the middle class she represents the middle class she will help rebuild the middle class. The belief that Warren is fighting for them on issues such as income inequality and regulating Wall Street is the driving force behind their effort to try and draft her into the race -- even though she repeatedly has dismissed it.READ: Could Warren-mania hurt progressive Democrats?""We totally take Senator Warren at her word right now "" said Blair Lawton Iowa Field Director for the Run Warren Run campaign. ""We know that right now she's not running and if she was we wouldn't have a reason for a draft campaign like this. Really me and my staff's goal everyday is to show her that she has got support all across the state and a path to victory.""That includes holding meetings to teach volunteers grassroots political techniques setting up phone banks to call Iowa Democrats and having Run Warren Run representatives attend small Democratic meetings across the state.Beth Farvour a Run Warren Run regional field director attended one such meeting on a Saturday morning in Tipton. In the basement of the courthouse Farvour staffed a table with literature and signs and addressed the 40 or so Cedar County Democrats to explain why she thinks the Massachusetts senator is the best candidate for the Democratic nomination. Farvour who spoke before headliner Martin O'Malley appeared was politely received as were the representatives trying to make similar cases for Sen. Bernie Sanders I-Vermont and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. It is still early in Iowa and Clinton is still the frontrunner.The Run Warren Run campaign is being funded by Moveon.org which has pledged to spend $1 million on the effort and Democracy for America which has chipped in an additional $250 000. In Iowa the campaign has eight staff who travel the state promoting her candidacy. Run Warren Run also has staffers in New Hampshire.At this time Warren's supporters -- almost to a person -- will not address the unthinkable: that the Massachusetts senator will stand by her word and not run for the White House.""I think we can get her in the race "" said Katie Freerksen a veterinarian technician who started volunteering three months ago. ""I think we are capable of it because this has grown so much since I have gotten involved.""Toria Pinter a law student who is on medical leave said that she was drawn to Warren because of the senator's vocal call to lower the interest rates on student loans. Pinter said people should not misconstrue this campaign as anti-Clinton effort but rather a pro-Warren movement.""The campaign is not about Clinton "" she said. ""That's not what we are here to talk about. We are here to talk about Warren and how important she is to us. Because she embodies the ideals and issues that are important to us at the end of the day.""Lawton said even if Warren decides not to run he believes there are some long-term benefits from this campaign including ""putting a big investment into the progressive community.""""I am confident every day if we do our job we get her to enter this race "" he said. ""But also you know other goals as well on top of getting her to run: I want to make sure every time a campaign comes in we are leaving the community in a better place. So really what we are doing right now by getting volunteers involved and training them we are really helping to build the progressive movement across the state of Iowa.""Hide Caption17 of 17Elizabeth Warren's career 17 photosSen.

In northeastern Pennsylvania a man was killed after his car overturned on an icy road and he was thrown from it and hit by a commercial vehicle. In Connecticut police cited slippery conditions in a crash that killed an 88-year-old woman who struck a utility pole in New Haven.Pennsylvania Department of Transportation spokesman Eugene Blaum called travel conditions ""very hazardous"" due to light rain falling onto cold surfaces creating a sheet of ice.""This is the worst type of winter precipitation to combat because it can freeze instantly and it doesn't need to be the whole pavement for vehicles crossing it to have problems "" Blaum said.The National Weather Service warned Sunday night that temperatures were expected to drop below freezing in areas from northern Maryland into Philadelphia and up through northern New Jersey. Any remaining moisture on roadways and sidewalks could re-freeze and drivers were urged to use caution until conditions improve. Temperatures were expected to hit the 40s by midday Monday in the area.Kaitlyn Maier grew up in upstate New York but said that didn't prepare her for the icy conditions she encountered trying to get from her home in Philadelphia to her niece's baptism.""I've driven through snow a lot and this isn't like anything I've ever driven in "" Maier told The Associated Press.She came upon the I-76 wreck moments after it happened and saw a jumbled line of cars extending around the bend ahead of her. ""We were stopped for a while on the side of the road. I was going less than 10 mph but I had no control of my vehicle.""Maier said emergency responders directed her and other drivers to turn around on the highway and drive eastbound on the westbound side to the next exit.Within the next several minutes Maier saw two cars collide and two other accidents that had just happened. They decided to stop at a diner to wait until the roads cleared.In New Hampshire parts of major highways were closed as ice caused dozens of accidents. WMUR reported that at one point Sunday afternoon both sides of Interstate 93 the state's major thoroughfare were closed due to accidents. As of late Sunday afternoon the station reported that approximately 45 accidents had taken place. State officials told the station that at one point they had no tow trucks or ambulances to respond to emergency calls. In the Pacific Northwest wind and rain caused havoc for residents of the Seattle area. Downed trees causing power outages were reported in some parts of the city while waterlogged roads made driving difficult. In eastern Oregon highway officials partially reopened Interstate 84 Sunday after a massive crash blamed on black ice Saturday closed more than 160 miles of eastbound lanes. Rain was expected in western Oregon Sunday and Monday but not as much as fell on Saturday when 1.8 inches of rain in Portland sent some untreated sewage into the Willamette River.Dozens of spinouts and accidents were reported from northern New Jersey to southern New Hampshire on Sunday and treacherous conditions forced the closure of the New York State Thruway from Newburgh to New York City during the morning.

I'm pregnant "" the victim said.Responding police heard a woman's cry for help inside the home and found her on a bed going in and out of consciousness just barely able to speak. A knife with a 3-inch blade was found under the bed.'Covered in blood'Searching the split-level home police found several bloody towels being laundered in the washing machine.David Ridley the 35-year-old husband of Dynel Lane told police he had returned home earlier after leaving work to meet his wife.As the husband walked downstairs toward the basement his wife walked around the corner ""covered in blood "" the police report said.""She told David she just miscarried and the baby was in the bathtub upstairs "" the police report said.A baby in the bathtubAfter Ridley saw his bloody wife he ran to the bathroom and found ""a small baby lying in the bathtub "" the police report said.""He rubbed the baby slightly then rolled it over to ... see it take a gasping breath "" the report said.Ridley wrapped the baby in a towel and apparently unaware that its mother was still bleeding inside the house drove the baby and his wife to the emergency room of Longmont United Hospital police said.A 'well performed' incisionWilkins was later taken for treatment at the same hospital police said.The emergency room surgeon noticed the victim had an incision on her abdomen that ""appeared to be well performed "" the report said.The doctor observed that ""the person who did the incision would have to have researched the subject of cesarean births in books or online to achieve the level of accuracy "" the police report said.Lane was a certified nurse aide starting July 1 2010 and her license expired on January 31 2012 with no history of discipline or board actions according to records with the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies. At that time she lived in Pueblo Colorado the records showed.No signs of giving birthWhile at the hospital with Lane a police investigator ""saw no visual signs of vaginal bleeding coming from Dynel or any signs of having recently given birth "" police said.Lane refused to allow hospital staff to examine her vaginally according to police.""Dynel admitted to Detective Stacey Graham that she cut abdomen open to remove [the victim's] baby "" according to the police report.The hospital told police ""the baby was approximately 7 months old and would have been viable "" the report said.Police then obtained a warrant to search Lane's body. The findings of that search weren't revealed Thursday.Suggestions of another lost pregnancyLane had told her family months earlier that she was pregnant even showing them an ultrasound photo of a boy in December.Her husband's early departure from work was to take her to a prenatal appointment police said.But one of Lane's two teenage daughters later told investigators that ""she could not tell Dynel was pregnant and [she] was very petite.""When asked Thursday whether Lane may have earlier lost a pregnancy prosecutors said they couldn't comment.""I can tell you we're looking very thoroughly at Ms. Lane's history and the police are investigating every aspect "" Boulder County District Attorney Stanley L.

The parents of Michael Alexander Cruz were listed as Jason and Dynel Cruz.A murder?Prosecutors are weighing whether to file a murder charge against Lane who won't face any formal charges until next week at the earliest Garnett said.The prosecutor described the difficulty in determining charges.""The issue of whether or not murder charges are appropriate involving a case involving the death of a fetus or a late-term pregnancy is always a difficult issue "" Garnett said.""Under Colorado law essentially there's no way murder charges can be brought if it's not established that the fetus lived as a child outside the body of the mother for some period of time. I don't know the answer yet as to whether that can be established what our facts are here "" Garnett said.That information will be a key part of the investigation Garnett said.Dozens of officers are working the case and awaiting medical information from an autopsy Garnett added.The definition of ""lived as a child"" is difficult too and whether that means one breath or one hour Garnett said.""The Supreme Court and the court of appeals will get to tell us that eventually.

The focus of the Boston Marathon bombing trial figures to be as much on what punishment Dzhokhar Tsarnaev could face as on his responsibility for the attack. With testimony expected to start later in January 2015 the Justice Department has given no indication it is open to any proposal from the defense to spare Tsarnaev's life pushing instead toward a trial that could result in a death sentence. (AP Photo/FBI File) (The Associated Press)BOSTON  Jury selection in the federal death penalty trial of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is going slower than expected. Here's what you need to know as the trial enters its third week:THE CASE:Tsarnaev 21 is charged in a deadly terror attack on the 2013 Boston Marathon. Two pressure-cooker bombs placed near the finish line killed three people including an 8-year-old boy and injured more than 260. Prosecutors say Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan planted and detonated the bombs in retaliation for U.S. wars in Muslim countries. Tamerlan Tsarnaev died in a shootout with police several days after the bombings.JURY SELECTION:Individual questioning of prospective jurors began last week and Judge George O'Toole Jr. originally said he would question 40 people each day. But only 34 people were questioned during the first two days. More than 1 350 people have filled out juror questionnaires.Prospective jurors are called into the courtroom in groups of about 20 and given initial instructions from the judge. O'Toole has told potential jurors that they will decide whether Tsarnaev lives or dies. Seventeen of the 30 charges against Tsarnaev are capital crimes punishable by death. Tsarnaev sits at a large table surrounded by his lawyers and across the table from prosecutors. The judge sits near the prospective jurors and does most of the questioning. The judge has been allowing prosecutors and Tsarnaev's lawyers to ask follow-up questions.THE DEFENDANT:Tsarnaev's curly hair was long and unkempt during the first phase of jury selection. He also had a scruffy beard. When individual questioning started Tsarnaev had a haircut and his beard was neatly trimmed. He spent much of the time looking down and drawing on a legal pad and occasionally looked at jurors as they were questioned.PROSPECTIVE JURORS:Many of the 34 people questioned so far do not appear likely to be picked for the jury. Some have expressed strong opposition to the death penalty and said they could not impose it under any circumstances. Others have said the predicted three- to four-month trial would be a serious financial hardship. Still others said they have not formed an opinion about Tsarnaev's guilt and would be willing to consider both life in prison or the death penalty if he is convicted.Some people had poignant responses that could keep them off the jury. One woman choked back tears when she spoke of Martin Richard the 8-year-old Dorchester boy who was killed in the attack. A man said his wife is an intensive care nurse who treated people injured in the bombing. A woman said her husband is a state trooper and she would find it difficult to be impartial given that Tsarnaev is also accused of killing an Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer.WHAT'S NEXT:On Tuesday the judge will bring in another group of prospective jurors for individual questioning. The process will continue each day until a group of 60 to 70 people have been qualified as potential jurors. After that Tsarnaev's lawyers and prosecutors will be allowed to eliminate some people from juror consideration without stating a reason. A panel of 12 jurors and six alternates will be chosen. The judge has said he hopes to begin testimony on Jan. 26.,http://us.cnn.com/2015/04/02/us/13th-juror-boston-trial-defense/index.html,The 13th Juror: What defense?,"Boston (CNN)I like when stories have two sides when I'm challenged to view events through different people's eyes. But as the defense rested in the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev I felt deflated and so did others who've been watching.""Limp.""""Lame.""""Weak.""Those were the words I heard afterward in the hallway outside the courtroom.The 13th JurorNo cameras are allowed at the Tsarnaev trial. But CNN's Ann O'Neill will be there every day. Think of her as The 13th Juror bringing insights here weekly. And follow @AnnoCNN on Twitter daily.Prosecutors spent 15 days unspooling the vivid accounts of people who were broken in body by the bombs but not in spirit. They showed videos of the defendant lurking in the crowd like a shark. One minute he is carrying a backpack over his shoulder; the next he is running away without it.They offered up heart-stopping details of a cop-killing a carjacking and a shootout with police. They even took the jury on a field trip to view a scrawled manifesto in a boat pocked by bullets and streaked with blood.Then prosecutors closed out their case with gruesome photos of three spectators blown apart near the finish line of the 2013 Boston Marathon.The defense presented just four witnesses who talked about the science of Internet searches and fingerprints. The sidebar conferences with the judge seemed to take almost as long as the testimony -- all of six hours. After the drama of the prosecution's case the defense seemed dry and hard to follow.But make no mistake: This trial has never been about whether Tsarnaev did it. The defense concedes his involvement. This is a death penalty case. Seventeen of the 30 counts against Tsarnaev known to friends as Jahar carry a possible death sentence. They allege he set off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism. The only question is whether he should pay with his life.The defense case whatever it is is yet to come.Boston bombing suspect Jahar Tsarnaev was found hiding on a boat.At this stage the so-called ""guilt phase"" of a capital trial there wasn't much else the defense could do. Their hands were tied: The prosecution got to tell a story and all the defense could do was try to poke holes in the narrative.The defense case -- presented by Judy Clarke David Bruck Miriam Conrad and William Fick -- might have seemed scattershot so far but there was a point: to pin the blame on the dead guy the defendant's older brother.Tamerlan Tsarnaev a 26-year-old Golden Gloves boxer was the more radicalized of the two brothers according to the defense. He's the one who wanted to wage jihad. He's the one who died as a martyr.His little brother the follower was left holding the bag.Three Boston Marathon spectators including an 8-year-old boy were killed in the blasts. Tamerlan died in a shootout with police in Watertown a few days after the bombings. A campus cop at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology also was shot and killed by the brothers allegedly for his gun.Defense witnesses testified about the bomb-making materials and the jihadist literature. They put all of them in Tamerlan's hands. The militant material was traced to Tamerlan's laptop hard drive -- although it also was on Jahar's laptop -- and to a mystery thumb drive. The dates of the computer file transfers roughly coincide with Tamerlan's visit to Russia.Tamerlan's laptop was used in the weeks before the bombings to search for information on the type of gun used to kill MIT police officer Sean Collier as well as terms such as ""detonators "" ""transmitters and receivers"" and ""fireworks firing systems.""Jahar the defense argued spent most of his computer time on Facebook and the Russian version of Facebook. A defense expert contradicted the prosecution's assertion that Jahar began to consider bombing the marathon a year earlier.His Twitter posts from the day of the 2012 Boston Marathon included mundane musings on whether he should sleep in or get breakfast.""Sleep after breakfast is always sweeter "" he tweeted.The bombs were likely built in the Tsarnaev family's Cambridge apartment from pressure cookers bought at Macy's BBs purchased at Wal-Mart gunpowder from fireworks duct tape Christmas lights and nails. Tamerlan purchased a toy car radio transmitter on Amazon.One witness said a room off the apartment's kitchen looked like a ""construction site."" There investigators found Tamerlan's fingerprints all over the place but not Jahar's.Tamerlan's prints were found on the duct tape a soldering gun a glass jar containing nails and a how-to book on wiring. They were found on cardboard and a scrap of paper inside the backpack carrying the first bomb that went off outside Marathon Sports on Boylston Street.The defense is looking ahead. Once the question of Tsarnaev's guilt is settled by the jury the case will move into its next chapter the penalty phase. For the defense saving Jahar Tsarnaev from the death penalty depends on building a case that shows he wasn't the mastermind but rather a troubled pawn of his brother's.Lead defense attorney Clarke has successfully fought for the lives of some of the most notorious killers of our times -- Unabomber Ted Kaczynski; 1996 Olympics bomber Eric Rudolph; Zacarias Moussaoui the so-called 20th hijacker on 9/11; Buford Furrow a member of Aryan Nation who killed a postal worker and shot at kids in a Jewish day care center; and Jared Lee Loughner the Arizona man who shot U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords and killed six others.Both sides have rested in United States vs. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and the attorneys will make their final arguments to the jury on Monday. We've nearly reached the end of the first stretch of the journey and it was all but a foregone conclusion.We knew it was going to be a mismatch the moment Clarke conceded in her opening statement: ""He was there."" She urged jurors to keep their ""hearts and minds open"" to consider questions that the defense couldn't answer during this first phase of the trial.In the penalty phase prosecutors will present evidence of aggravating factors that make this crime especially heinous and they are likely to call bombing victims to give emotionally compelling victim impact testimony.The defense will finally get to tell its story. There are few clues in the court file as to what that might be but Tsarnaev's lawyers are almost certain to delve into his family history.Tsarnaev was 8 when his mother and father brought him to the United States from Russia during a vacation. The family is Muslim -- his father is Chechen -- and his parents received asylum; they sent later for Tsarnaev's older brother and two sisters.His parents divorced and returned to Dagestan as he entered college. They have not been in the courtroom for the trial. In fact nobody but his lawyers seems to be present in court for Tsarnaev.At age 8 Martin Richard was the youngest victim in the Boston Marathon bombing.The defense will likely probe more deeply into Tsarnaev's relationship with his older brother. Clarke has told jurors that he revered -- and feared -- Tamerlan. And they could present evidence of mental illness in the family.One fact that has haunted this trial -- and will be an aggravating factor for the prosecution -- is the age of the youngest bombing victim Martin Richard. Tsarnaev's relative youth on the other hand lines up in the column of mitigating factors.He was 19 when he dropped his backpack containing a homemade pressure cooker bomb directly behind Martin Richard. The boy's 69-pound body took the brunt of the explosion.""He was 8 years old "" the medical examiner testified.Those were the final words spoken from the witness stand in the government's case.If Tsarnaev is convicted which is very likely to happen in the coming week the defense will have an opportunity to get in its last word."21,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/01/22/woman-excused-from-colorado-theater-shooting-jury-amid-concerns-about-panic/,Woman excused from Colorado theater shooting jury amid concerns about panic attacks,CENTENNIAL Colo.

No more spotlight like the death penalty brings.""No martyrdom. Just years and years of punishment day after day as he grows up to deal with the lonely struggle of dealing with what he did.""Tsarnaev 21 was convicted this month of all 30 counts against him; 17 of those counts carry the death penalty for the murders of four -- Krystle Campbell 29; Lingzi Lu 23; Martin Richard 8; and Sean Collier 26.In deciding whether the former college student is executed for his crimes or spends the rest of his days in a high-security federal prison jurors must weigh the heinousness of his crime and the toll on his victims against so-called mitigating factors such as his relative youth mental health and family background and whether or not he is remorseful.He has shown no emotion as he sits in court and he has avoided eye contact with maimed bombing survivors and relatives of the dead.Last week federal prosecutors presented three days of gut-wrenching victim impact testimony including an array of images showing the victims as happy active people and edited videos that added a soundtrack featuring a loud explosion screams and panicked voices to the horrific bombing scene outside the Forum restaurant where Richard and Lu died.Boston Marathon bomber flips the bird at camera 01:55PLAY VIDEOLead defense attorney Judy Clarke -- a nationally known death penalty opponent -- has acknowledged that Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan set off the bombs and shot MIT campus cop Collier. But she is expected to build a narrative showing her client as a puppet of his dominant older brother.Tamerlan Tsarnaev who was 26 died in a gunbattle with Watertown Massachusetts police three days after the bombings.Clarke's colleague Bruck began that narrative in his opening statement by noting ""The man who conceived planned and led this crime is beyond our power to punish. Only the 19-year-old younger brother who helped is left.""Several members of Tsarnaev's family arrived in Boston over the weekend but the defense is closely guarding its witness list. The relatives who are at an undisclosed location after being forced to leave a suburban hotel apparently do not include his parents who divorced and returned to Dagestan before the April 15 2013 bombings.Court filings indicate that the defense plans to call expert witness Janet Vogelsang a sociologist to explain Tsarnaev's difficult upbringing as the overlooked child of immigrants -- displaced Russian Muslims whose American dream failed.Under federal law the jury's decision must be unanimous. A deadlocked jury would result in an automatic life sentence for Tsarnaev -- which means the defense only needs to convince one juror to spare his life.The Boston Globe reported over the weekend that fewer than 20% of those polled in Massachusetts favor the death penalty for Tsarnaev. The number is down substantially since the days after the bombings."22,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/01/23/university-michigan-fraternity-suspended-after-causing-50g-in-damage-to-ski/,University of Michigan fraternity suspended after causing $50G in damage to ski resort,"This photo shows a damaged room at the Treetops Resort in Dover Township Mich.

Chris Christie left; Texas Sen. Ted Cruz center; and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. (AP)WASHINGTON  Call it the unofficial kick-off of the 2016 Republican presidential race. Two-dozen Republican politicians -- nearly half of them at least considering a run for the White House -- are descending on downtown Des Moines this weekend for the Iowa Freedom Summit where they'll test their conservative chops before a sold-out crowd. The summit which was held in New Hampshire last time around is only in its second year but is drawing an impressive amount of GOP star power. The heavy-hitting lineup in the first-in-the-nation caucus state effectively makes it the first major candidate forum of the cycle. ""Odds are the next president of the United States will be there "" said Rep. Steve King R-Iowa who is sponsoring the event along with Citizens United. The Saturday event is being held as the field of potential 2016 candidates grows ever-larger with 2012 nominee Mitt Romney and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush making moves toward a run. The two former governors will not be in Iowa but here's who will: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie former Texas Gov. Rick Perry Texas Sen. Ted Cruz former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. Others slated to speak include neurosurgeon and conservative firebrand Ben Carson Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and businessman Donald Trump as well as former Hewlett-Packard head Carly Fiorina and former U.N. ambassador John Bolton. All at least carry with them presidential speculation; most are openly flirting with a bid. The Iowa summit which lasts all day Saturday will be their biggest chance so far to test-run their messages with Iowa voters. For some -- particularly those with appeal to social conservatives a powerful bloc in the Hawkeye State -- it's a chance to stand out in a crowded field. Potential candidates like Santorum who have been out of the game since the last race could use some heartland buzz. At the same time the setting could test the reach of more moderate GOP figures. ""A lot will depend on exactly what they will say "" said Lara Brown director of the political management program at George Washington University. ""At some level people have to decide what are the issues that bring them together and what are the issues that will turn them off."" But she noted ""For every Republican nominee they have to have support from the Republican right and the evangelical community."" Christie -- known more for his record battling the unions and his Jersey-style put-downs than his work on issues that drive caucus-goers -- is one to watch. Brown believes the New Jersey governor will spend his time hammering home the message he's pro-life. ""He may also feel that he should address his stance on immigration and what he experienced as a governor in a state that has a lot of immigrants "" she said. Also generating some buzz is Walker who unlike many other potential candidates has been busy running for reelection. His spokesman Tom Everson said in a statement the governor is looking forward to ""sharing the story of Wisconsin's successful reforms.""

The slow movement of the storm he said could help produce quite a bit of snowfall and blizzard-like or blizzard conditions: at least three hours of wind gusts of 35 mph or greater and visibility of less than a quarter of a mile because of snow or blowing snow.The storm could stall before it tracks out to sea bringing high wind heavy precipitation and the potential for coastal flooding the National Weather Service said. It would be the second wallop for the Northeast after what happened Saturday when a storm crawling up the East Coast left a slushy snowy coating from Pennsylvania to New England.The storm dumped at least 9 inches of snow in parts of Pennsylvania and 8 inches in parts of New York northern New Jersey and northwestern Connecticut with widespread reports of more than 4 inches in inland areas across southern New England. Lighter amounts were reported in Philadelphia Boston and New York City where the snowfall stopped Saturday evening.About 8 inches of snow fell in far eastern Maine before the storm moved out late Saturday night.Numerous accidents were reported on the slick roads but there were no major highway backups in the lighter weekend traffic.

(AP)Social media is agog over George Clooney's tribute to his wife Amal at last weekend's Golden Globe Awards in Hollywood. Women especially are swooning in their tweets and Facebook postings.Said Clooney ""Listen it's humbling to find somebody to love especially when you've been waiting your whole life especially when your whole life is 53 years ... Amal whatever alchemy brought us together I couldn't be more proud to be your husband.""I admit the tribute was sweet and his wife is drop-dead gorgeous but Clooney twice named ""The Sexiest Man Alive"" by People magazine and known for his numerous relationships with women has only been married four months. Maybe in Hollywood four months is considered a long-term relationship but let's see if they make it to their 49th anniversary as my wife and I did Thursday.Someone recently asked me how we have managed to stay married. I answered ""forgiveness.""What produced such a mushy reaction from women to Clooney's remarks? I think part of it is that in our modern ""relationship"" era where people have ""partners"" not spouses it is a rare thing to see a famous man publicly expressing love for his wife. As Phil Collins put it in a song ""Doesn't anybody stay together anymore; I wonder why doesn't anybody stay together anymore?""I think the answer to ""why"" is that our culture has redefined ""love."" In 1984 when Tina Turner sang ""What's Love Got to Do with It "" that song might have been the anthem for a generation.What is ""love""? If it isn't more than feelings a superficial sugar rush that occurs when one is near someone special what happens when the feelings subside? No marriage can be sustained at the level of teenage romance (cue the late Ricky Nelson): ""A teenager's romance is fickle or true; a teenager's romance is red hot or blue; you're either in misery or high on a crest; a teenager's romance is like all the rest.""Uh not exactly Ricky.Some years ago I introduced my wife to a colleague at a Christmas party this way: ""I want you to meet my first wife."" Later he sought me out and asked with a serious expression ""Why did you bring your first wife to the party?"" I replied ""It's the only one I've had."" He looked at me surprised as if I were a dinosaur at the Museum of Natural History.Maybe I am but it has worked for us. Has it always been perfect? Of course not. No marriage is and anyone who says so isn't telling the truth. When two imperfect people marry you double the imperfections. Someone recently asked me how we have managed to stay married. I answered ""forgiveness.""If you admit you are far from a model man and husband and look for the good in the other person you will find it. Fault doesn't require a long search. It begins in the mirror.So happy anniversary Charlotte Ray. I don't look like George Clooney but I'm grateful you find me appealing. Besides in a very short time George and Amal won't look like they do today.I hope they stay married. I know we will. As the old Perry Como song goes:""Till the end of timeLong as stars are in the blueLong as there's a spring of birdsTo sing I'll go on loving you.""Women you may swoon on my Facebook page.Cal Thomas is America's most widely syndicated op-ed columnist.

The other plane was carrying four people and went down several miles off Oahu.NTSB investigator Josh Cawthra said both planes sank and he didn't know if they would be recovered. He said he had not yet spoken with either pilot and had few other details.Dramatic Coast Guard video shows the plane carrying just the pilot a Cirrus SR22 traveling from California to Maui as it releases its parachute. The plane drops nose-first and then levels out and plops into the sea.The pilot escapes out the top of the aircraft and drifts away in a small raft.The SR22 pilot traveling from Tracy California radioed authorities at 12:30 p.m. about plans to ditch the aircraft because of dwindling fuel. The plane has a range of about 1 200 miles only half the distance to Maui but it was equipped with an auxiliary fuel system according to Cawthra.The Coast Guard directed the plane to go down near a cruise ship and the pilot deployed the parachute system around 4:45 p.m. and safely got into a life raft. Amid 9- to 12-foot seas and winds of 25 to 28 mph the cruise-ship crew rescued the pilot who was in good condition authorities said.Parachutes are standard equipment on the SR22 and all other aircraft manufactured by Duluth Minnesota-based Cirrus Aircraft according to company spokesman Ben Kowalski.He said parachutes have been deployed on Cirrus aircrafts in 51 incidents and are responsible for saving a total of 104 lives including the pilot in Sunday's crash.Kowalski said he was not at liberty to identify the pilot an agent who was en route to Australia to deliver the aircraft to an owner. The SR22's starting price is listed at $499 900.In a second crash Sunday a single-engine Cessna flying from Kauai to Oahu with four people aboard declared an emergency at 6:18 p.m. saying fuel was running low and the plane might need to ditch the Coast Guard said.It crash-landed about 11 miles west of Oahu and a Coast Guard helicopter rescued three adults and one child.All four received emergency treatment but their conditions were not immediately available.,http://us.cnn.com/2015/01/20/asia/airasia-disaster-flight-speed/index.html,AirAsia flight climbed quickly  then stalled before crash  reports say,"Story highlightsPlane was climbing twice as fast as it should have been analyst saysAirAsia Flight QZ8501 ""went up faster than normal "" Indonesia's transportation minister saysAt one point the plane climbed at a speed of 6 000 feet per minute he says(CNN)AirAsia Flight QZ8501 climbed rapidly before it crashed a top Indonesian official said Tuesday.Then the plane stalled Transportation Minister Ignasius Jonan said at a parliamentary hearing according to the AFP and Reuters news agencies.""The plane during the last minutes went up faster than normal speed ... after then it stalled. That is according to the data from the radar "" Jonan said according to the news agencies.At one point the plane was climbing at a speed of 6 000 feet per minute Jonan told the hearing.A fighter jet like the F/A-18 Super Hornet can barrel through the air at 30 000 feet per minute. But commercial jets are designed to travel at a much slower rate.The latest data shows the AirAsia plane an Airbus A320 was climbing at a rate that was twice as fast as it ""could and should do on its own "" CNN Aviation Analyst Mary Schiavo said.""I think that means there was a tremendous amount of winds and weather "" she said.The commercial jet lost contact with air traffic controllers on December 28 as it flew from the Indonesian city of Surabaya toward Singapore with 162 people on board.Amid increasingly bad weather one of the pilots had requested to deviate from the plane's planned route AirAsia has said. And experts have speculated since Day One that storms might have played a role in the plane crash.If the plane was climbing at 6 000 feet per minute Schiavo said numerous alarms would have sounded in the cockpit. But if the aircraft got caught in an updraft she said the pilots might not have been aware at first of why it was climbing so quickly when they weren't inputting that into the controls.Picture your speedometer showing your car accelerating when your foot isn't pressing on the gas pedal.""The pilots would have had control of the plane "" she said ""but may not have even realized what was occurring because of the confusing readings from the aircraft.""Last week searchers recovered the plane's so-called black boxes which investigators hope will help them determine what happened aboard the doomed flight.Indonesian investigators say audio recordings from the plane's cockpit contain no sounds of gunfire or explosions making it unlikely the plane was brought down by terrorism.While transportation officials focus on figuring out what happened search teams are still looking for most of the bodies of the people who were on board the plane.More than three weeks after the crash the remains of 53 people have been recovered some of them still strapped into seats. Many of the rest could be in the wreckage of the fuselage which searchers located last week at the bottom of the sea.Efforts to examine and get inside the wreckage have been hindered by high waves and strong currents."28,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/01/06/2-nypd-officers-shot-wounded-by-bronx-armed-robber/,Manhunt on for 2 suspected of shooting NYPD cops responding to robbery,"Manhunt underway after two NYPD officers shotA massive manhunt was on in New York after two NYPD officers were shot while trying to stop a robbery in the Bronx late Monday in the latest case of the nations largest police force coming under fire on the street.Both Andrew Dossi and Aliro Pellarano who had just finished a plainclothes tour were expected to survive.

But like Brown Ezell Ford was an unarmed black man shot and killed by police in August.Now newly released details of Ford's death could raise a host of new questions.Among the findings: The 25-year-old was shot three times including once in the back. And that wound was surrounded by a muzzle imprint Ford's autopsy report shows.But ""there is nothing in the coroner's report that is inconsistent with the statements given to us by the officers "" Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck said.Ford was shot by Los Angeles police on August 11 -- two days after Brown was killed.The Los Angeles County coroner's office released the autopsy Monday after the Los Angeles police removed its security hold on it.The LAPD had put an administrative hold on Ford's autopsy because the department said it wanted witnesses to come forward before the autopsy's release.What happened?The circumstances leading up to Ford's death aren't exactly clear.According to one of the officers involved he and Ford got into a ""violent struggle "" Beck said.Ford ended up on top of the officer with Ford in control of the officer's pistol the police chief said.""The officer drew his backup gun and reached over Mr. Ford's back and shot Mr. Ford in very close proximity -- possibly probably the cause of the muzzle imprint that's mentioned in the coroner's report "" Beck said.Ford's family has said he was mentally ill and unarmed.The police chief said the investigation is far from over.""We continue to seek the public's assistance. Any information regarding this incident will help us complete this picture "" Beck said.He said police have not been able to reach any civilian witnesses who actually saw the shooting.""We still are searching for witnesses. We still are looking for other versions of events.""He said the district attorney will make the final determination about whether the shooting met legal standards.Before the autopsy's release a Los Angeles community leader wondered how the shooting could be justified.""How do you explain when you have this level of deadly force against those that are not even accused of committing a crime and are not even armed?"" asked Earl Ofari Hutchinson of the Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable.The two officers involved have been assigned to non-field duties as the investigation continues."29,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/02/08/7-people-shot-5-dead-in-georgia-shooting/,5 dead  including gunman  in Georgia shooting  police say,"Feb. 7 2015: Police stand in the doorway of a home while investigating the shooting scene where authorities say five people are dead including the gunman in Douglasville Ga.

Terror group seizes Iraqi town 5 miles from Marine base,"ISIS advancing in Iraq's Anbar provinceNever autoplay videosIslamic State has reportedly seized al-Baghdadi in Iraqs Anbar Province 5 miles from an air base staffed by U.S. Marines as the terror group continues its push beyond its bases in Syria and Iraq in an attempt to establish militant affiliates in other countries.Hundreds of Islamic State fighters reportedly captured most of al-Baghdadi which is 55 miles from the capital Ramadi on Thursday.On Friday Iraqi soldiers had retaken several government buildings but the soldiers withdrew early Saturday handing the town back to the militants The New York Times reported citing local security officials.One local Iraqi official told Reuters that ""Ninety percent of al-Baghdadi district has fallen under the control of the insurgents.""Militants attacked the town of al-Baghdadi from two directions before advancing inward Reuters reported.According to the Pentagon al-Baghdadi was the first territorial gain by the militant group in months.On Friday following the attack on al-Baghdadi Islamic state fighters led a suicide attack on the Ayn al-Asad air base where U.S. Marines are training Iraqi troops.Most of the Islamic State fighters died in the suicide attack killed either by Iraqi government forces or by detonating their suicide vests said Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby the Pentagon spokesman.Kirby said an estimated 20-25 Islamic State militants were involved in the attack on al-Asad air base in Iraq's Anbar province. He said the attack was led by ""at least several"" suicide bombers some of whom managed to detonate their bombs while others were killed by Iraqi troops.It appeared that most if not all of the militants were wearing Iraqi uniforms Kirby said.No Iraqi or U.S. troops were killed or wounded Kirby said and no U.S. troops were involved in the gunfight.This isn't the flu Rep. Peter King R-N.Y. told Greta Van Susteren during On The Record Friday. The fact is those 300 Marines [at al-Asad] are the toughest guys around. And they are well-armed. But the fact that the ISIS attack today didn't work doesn't mean that it couldn't work in the future said King.We have been given a warning signal and we must take action.- Air Force Lt. Gen. Tom McInerneyAir Force Lt. Gen. Tom McInerney says the United States must use force in the area seizing control of the key roads Islamic State also known as ISIS will need to continue its march toward the capital.We have been given a warning signal and we must take action McInerney (Ret.) told Fox News Sunday. The best defense is a good offense.A Defense Department spokeswoman confirmed to Fox News that heavy fighting took place in the area on Thursday but referred questions about the status of al-Baghdadi to the Iraqi government.There was no direct attack on the al-Asad air base the spokeswoman assured while acknowledging reports of ineffective indirect fire in the vicinity of the base.The area in Anbar Province has long been a hot zone of fighting as ISIS looks to hold and expand its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria. In January the Pentagon first confirmed that U.S. troops at the Al Asad base had been coming under regular mortar fire.To date those attacks have been described as ineffective. A senior U.S. official told Fox News the base receives low-scale indirect fire from time to time.We continue to support efforts by Iraqi Security Forces working in conjunction with tribal fighters directed against ISIL in the province the DOD spokeswoman said Thursday.Another Pentagon spokesman Col.

Freezing rain was forecast for northern Mississippi and 2 to 4 inches of snow and sleet is possible in north Georgia.A storm also threatened to hit Atlanta where just over a year ago an ice storm trapped commuters for hours on the region's freeways. The Atlanta metro area is expected to see cold rain throughout the day which could turn into icy spots for Tuesdays morning commute after temperatures dip below freezing overnight MyFoxAtlanta.com reports.Matthew Belk of the National Weather Service told the Associated Press that the storm may turn north after heading out to sea and drop a fresh round of snow on the Northeast on Tuesday though it's unclear how much.The Arctic cold front already had frozen the upper Midwest with temperatures in Michigan plunging to minus-27 in the Upper Peninsula.Freezing temperatures forced the cancellation of hundreds of flights nationwide with more than 900 flights canceled as of Monday morning according to the flight tracking website FlightAware.com.A number of flights were diverted from Dulles International airport in Northern Virginia on Sunday night after a water pipe in the tower burst triggering an alarm and evacuation.But Chris Paolino a spokesman for the airport said the Federal Aviation Administration flight tower returned to full capacity around 6:30 a.m. Monday.The National Weather Service said a low temperature of 3 degrees was recorded at 7:35 a.m. at Philadelphia International Airport. That's just under the record for the date of 2 degrees set way back in 1888.Bone-chilling temperatures also prompted the closure of public schools in Pittsburgh and all parish and regional Catholic elementary schools in Philadelphia.Out west in Denver another 1-3 inches of snow are expected Monday in the Metro area after a heavy snowstorm caused multiple accidents Sunday Fox 31 Denver reports.Parts of Texas are also expected to become icy after Monday rainfall according to KDFW.

Forecasters called for residents to limit their exposure to the elements and warned that frostbite could strike in less than 10 minutes. The high winds were also expected to reduce visibility create snowdrifts and hinder cleanup efforts.""It's historic "" Frank Libby told the Associated Press as he walked down a deserted street in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood on Sunday.

Obama had been scheduled to return to Washington late TuesdayObama's travel schedule was changed so that he could meet with the new king and other Saudi officials after his speech in India Tuesday. Vice President Joe Biden will stay in Washington.Saudi Arabia has long been a key U.S. ally and a bulwark against Irans reach. Given the line of succession King Abdullah's half-brother Salman bin Abdul-Aziz Al Saud has replaced him the former diplomat did not expect major policy changes in the short-term. Indeed Salman said in a speech that aired on the state-run Saudi television that the country will adhere to the same policies it has followed ""since its establishment.""Salman made an oblique reference to the chaos gripping the greater Middle East as the extremist Islamic State group now holds a third of both Iraq and Syria.""The Arab and the Islamic nations are in dire need of solidarity and cohesion "" he said.A former U.S. diplomat told Fox News that the Saudi policy on matters like Yemen has not been clear since 2009 and the diplomat even anticipated a softer stance from the Kingdom on Syria where the late king committed Saudi airpower to fighting the Islamic State.Abdullah's death may also open up a bigger power vacuum in Riyadh than first believed. The Wall Street Journal reported that U.S. officials do not consider the 79-year-old Salman to be a strong or healthy ruler in his own right which raises the possibility that others in the royal family could come to the forefront.Most immediately the Obama administration faces a critical challenge in Yemen where President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi a U.S. ally resigned Thursday after being held captive by Houthi rebels.The White House had originally said the vice president would lead a delegation to Saudi Arabia. However it was determined that the window when Biden would be on the ground in Riyadh coincided with Obama's departure from India. Obama in the meantime will be the first U.S. president to visit India twice while in office; he also traveled there in 2010 for an economic summit.The president's visit is expected to be heavy on symbolism and lighter on substantive advances though climate change economics and defense ties are all on the agenda. Indian political commentator Ashok Malik said expectations for concrete deliverables during the visit are ""below the standards usually set by U.S. presidents when they travel across the world for a three-day visit.""Still U.S. and Indian officials appear to agree that even a symbolic show of solidarity between the leaders would be a sign of progress after recent difficulties.While military cooperation and U.S. defense sales have grown Washington has been frustrated by India's failure to open up to more foreign investment and to address complaints alleging intellectual property violations. India's liability legislation has also prevented U.S. companies from capitalizing on a landmark civil nuclear agreement between the two countries in 2008.U.S. officials hope the improving relationship between Obama and Modi will payoff in the policy arena. The White House plans to push India on climate change.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",http://us.cnn.com/2015/01/24/politics/saudi-king-succession-washington/index.html,Washington sighs relief at Saudi succession,"Story highlightsUS relieved at succession plan roll-out after King Abdullah's deathSaudi Arabia a key anti-terror ally in volatile regionBut tensions still simmer with Riyadh over IranWashington (CNN)Finally something went right for the United States in the Middle East.Relief is palpable in Washington over the well-planned and seamlessly executed transfer of Saudi Arabia's throne to King Salman bin Abdulaziz 79 following the death of his 90-year-old half brother King Abdullah.The kingdom despite signaling rare public dissent with the Obama administration over Iran and the Arab Spring is a fulcrum of U.S. diplomacy in a region where Washington is struggling to adapt to dissolving national borders chaotic change and sectarian carnage.Never mind that the U.S. is the world's foremost democracy and the transfer of power in Saudi Arabia was from one autocrat to the next.Saudi Arabia is crucial to U.S. goals on counter-terrorism the campaign against ISIS and Al-Qaeda the free flow of energy that sustains the global economy as a counter-balance to Iran and as a sponsor of the long frustrated quest for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.In a sign of the kingdom's importance to the United States President Barack Obama made hurried plans to call in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday after his trip to India to pay his respects to Abdullah and his family and to meet with King Salman. Originally Vice President Joe Biden was to have made the trip.The message from Washington is clearly : Long live the new king.The regal choreography in Riyadh is especially welcome to the White House as it contrasts with events just across the border in Yemen another key ally where a US-backed government crucial to its anti-terror campaign has just been toppled to rebels supported by Iran.Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah 11 photosEXPAND GALLERYJames B. Smith who served as U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia between 2009 and 2013 said there should be no concern in the administration that Salman's ascension will jeopardize U.S. relations with the deeply conservative kingdom.Lines of succession""We know Salman well he was governor of Riyadh for the better part of 50 years he is well known to the US government. I see no break in the U.S.-Saudi relationship "" Smith said.Salman vowed just hours after the death of Abdullah that the kingdom ""would continue adhering to the correct policies which Saudi Arabia has followed since its establishment.""State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that the allies had a ""long history of cooperation. We don't have any indication that that cooperation will change.""Saudi watchers in Washington were impressed and reassured by the line of succession outlined by Salman in an apparent effort to solve a dynastic riddle and send a signal of continuity to the outside world.He named Prince Mohammed bin Nayef one of scores of posssible candidates as deputy crown prince a move which puts him second in line to the throne and establishes a future transfer of power from the sons of the founder of Saudi Arabia King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud who have ruled the country since the 1950s to a new generation.""I think for the near term continuity is going to be the centerpiece here "" said Daniel Benjamin a former coordinator for counter-terrorism at the State Department now at Dartmouth College told CNN.""There is now a member of the generation of the grandchildren who is second in line he is a very close friend of the United States ... so I think there is a lot of hope the relationship will stay on an even keel.""Prince Mohammed now behind the King's brother Prince Muqrin 69 in the line of succession is a frequent visitor to the United States and has presided over Saudi Arabia's anti-terrorism program. He narrowly escaped an assassination bid by Al-Qaeda in 2009.The succession plan was viewed as particularly important following unconfirmed reports that Salman has been in ill health himself apparently having suffered a stroke.Tom Donilon pointman for US relations with Saudi Arabia when he was Obama's National Security Advisor praised Abdullah as a ""solid"" ally who had ensured two decades of stability in the kingdom.He also said that the late King's survivors had done a ""pretty effective job of indicating stability with a quick annoncement with repect to succession continuity of policy.""He told ""The Lead"" with CNN's Jake Tapper that Mohammad known as MBN in the United States was ""a very very competent person who is essential in terms of our joint efforts to combat terrorists.""Periods of tensionThough there is relief at the apparent stability in Riyadh relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia in recent years have have often been troubled.There was a tense period a decade ago after it emerged that 15 of the 19 hijackers involved in the September 11 attacks originated from Saudi Arabia.Critics including some in the U.S. government faulted Saudis for backing jihadists movements throughout the region for geopolitical reasons.The Saudi government has also balked at U.S. criticisms of its human rights record and political system.What's next for Saudi's foreign relations? 03:49PLAY VIDEOQuestions about IranMore recently Saudi Arabia the key Sunni power in the Middle East has not hesitated to make clear its concern about Obama's quest to improve relations with its mighty Shia foe Iran with which it is fighting various proxy struggles.Saudi leaders were dismayed to learn about a secret backchannel of talks between the administration and Iran which built on the election of ""moderate"" Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in 2013 to launch an effort at rapprochment between Tehran and Washington.'""I think that the concern remains among the Saudi leadership about an agreement that is going to be at their expense "" said David Ottaway an author on Saudi Arabia and senior scholar at the Wilson Center.Some analysts believe that the Saudi government could react to what it would see as a bad nuclear deal between world powers and Iran -- which left the Islamic Republic with some capacity to enrich uranium or produce plutonium -- by looking to find its own nuclear capability -- perhaps with assistance from Pakistan.Saudi princes took to the op-ed pages of US newspapers in 2013 in a highly unusual move to complain that a nuclear deal was a ""dangerous gamble.""The Saudi government also made clear its deep anger with Obama's last-minute decision not to launch planned air strikes on Syria to punish the Bashar al-Assad regime's use of chemical weapons the same year.Saudi Arabia has also been frustrated at how long it has taken the United States to begin training opposition fighters in Syria.Anger at Obama comments on the Arab SpringThe Saudi government also registered anger at the Obama administration's embrace of Arab Spring uprisings which led to the ouster of allies like Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.Obama appeared to make an oblique reference to those differences in a statement honoring Abdullah on Thursday as a ""steadfast and passionate"" believer in US-Saudi relations as a force for stability.""As a leader he was always candid and had the courage of his convictions "" Obama wrote.In recent years the Obama administration has attempted to assuage Saudi fears. The US president made a visit to Riyadh last year on a trip that was widely seen as an attempt to mend fences.Saudi Arabian pilots reportedly including one of Salman's sons Prince Khaled helped carry out the first air attacks on ISIS in Syria last year.What do we know about Saudi Arabia's new king? 01:58PLAY VIDEOSaudi Arabia also approved of Secretary of State John Kerry's exhaustive but ultimately futile efforts to keep Israel and the Palestinians talking. And White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that an underpinning of those efforts an Arab Peace Plan framed by Abdullah would stand as his lasting memorial.Smith said that the relationship between Riyadh and Washington was now better than it had been earlier in the administration.""A key element of our relationship with the Saudis over the years has been transparency not always in public but we have done a good job in talking to each other "" he said.""When you leave your allies out of the conversation and they don't understand your negotiating position or don't understand how you are going to enforce an agreement. they are left to their own conclusions.""I think we are doing a lot better at that."""35,http://www.foxnews.com/weather/2015/02/17/parts-south-mid-atlantic-hit-by-snow-ice-and-deadly-cold/,Parts of South  Mid-Atlantic hit by snow  ice and deadly cold,"Feb. 16 2015: University of Kentucky students Courtney Wiseman left and Abby Lerner walk home after studying on campus even as classes were canceled for the day in Lexington.

The National Weather Service is predicting 6 to 8 inches of snow. Forecasters say most of the snow will fall overnight but there could still be some snow falling between 7 a.m. and 11 a.m.The federal government's closure is the first of this winter and will keep thousands of people off the area's roads and rail systems Tuesday. Elsewhere a state of emergency was declared in Tennessee where emergency officials have asked the National Guard to deploy a 10-person crew with Humvees to check on stranded motorists. The Tennessee Emergency Management Agency says motorists were backed up on Interstate 40 and part of I-24 was closed due to an earlier backup. The agency said that 55 000 people were without power late Monday. The February storm arrived on Presidents Day when many schools and businesses were already closed. But the day isn't a state holiday in North Carolina so schools let out early Monday and by the afternoon officials were canceling classes Tuesday. College campuses including from Appalachian State University in the western part of the state and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill canceled afternoon classes Monday. At one point nearly all of the state's 100 counties were under some kind of weather alert.North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory on Monday shut down all non-mandatory state government operations in Wake County in the early afternoon before any precipitation had fallen. He also declared a state of emergency and issued executive orders designed to streamline any storm cleanup. He encouraged supervisors elsewhere in the state to use their discretion in sending employees home. Duke Energy reported over 80 000 customers without power across North Carolina and the northern portion of South Carolina as of early Tuesday. In central Kentucky home to much of the state's signature thoroughbred industry horses kept warm by galloping through the deep snow pausing occasionally to shake it off from their thick winter coats. Ned Toffey general manager of Spendthrift Farm in Lexington said the horses enjoy running in the snow because it gives them a nice cushion as opposed to the harder packed earth.Still some weren't quite ready for the winter blast.RL Doss said he had already used his 1987 GMC Suburban which can haul up to three-quarters of a ton with ropes and chains to rescue several people and their cars on the hills surrounding Frankfort. Cars were fishtailing and sliding off the slick roads.""I look at it this way. Everybody is trying to get out to get their last bit of food and stuff getting home from work and people leaving for work and stuff and it happens "" he said shivering in a pair of tan overalls pulled over a hooded sweat shirt.Like his North Carolina counterpart Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear urged people to stay home if possible as parts of his state were buried under a foot of snow.In Arkansas where where temperatures plummeted from the 70s on Saturday to highs in the 30s a day later had nearly 30 000 people without power at the peak of the storm. But Arkansas safety and transportation officials said Monday the fallout from sleet and snow wasn't as bad as officials thought it would be. Arkansas State Police spokesman Bill Sadler said troopers didn't report any fatal or serious crashes in the morning hours as temperatures dropped to about 25 degrees in Little Rock. Officers were primarily responding to vehicles sliding off of the road he said.Freezing rain also fell as far south as Mississippi where more than 15 000 customers were without power Monday evening.Road crews and utility workers in South Carolina spent most of the day preparing for the weather treating roads and putting crews on standby. The state Highway Patrol said more than 80 wrecks had been reported in six Upstate counties by sundown Monday.Georgia officials took no chances bringing in more personnel to the state operations center and pre-treating roads with a mixture of salt and water. Georgia Power said that over 90 000 of its customers were without power early Tuesday. The winter-weary Northeast was spared precipitation Monday but had to deal with below-freezing temperatures and a wind-chill factor of well below zero. New York City came close to breaking a 127-year-old record when the temperature in Central Park hit 3 degrees just 2 degrees above the record set in 1888 said Jeffrey Tongue a National Weather Service meteorologist.Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh said the latest snow storm left one person dead apparently due to a heart attack while shoveling snow. A partial roof collapse at an eight-building apartment complex in Portsmouth New Hampshire left 500 to 700 people looking for shelter. In New Jersey a 66-year-old woman who had been drinking at a benefit was found dead in the snow just two doors from her home. Firefighters working on a blaze in Philadelphia left behind a building coated in icicles. No one was hurt.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

A police detective has described how officers found a shell casing and blue bubble gum that they used to link former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez to a June 2013 killing.North Attleborough police Detective Michael Elliott is being cross-examined by Hernandez lawyer James Sultan on Wednesday.Hernandez is charged with killing Odin Lloyd who was dating his fiancee's sister.Elliott said they were called by a rental car company worker who told them several items had been removed from a car Hernandez rented and put in a trash bin.Elliott said police searched the bin and found the shell casing attached to the gum.Sultan questioned the way police handled the items.Prosecutors have said Hernandez bought blue bubble gum shortly before the killing.,http://us.cnn.com/2015/01/29/us/massachusetts-aaron-hernandez-trial/index.html,Jury to hear opening statements in murder trial of NFL's Aaron Hernandez,"Story highlightsFormer Patriot tight end Aaron Hernandez 25 has pleaded not guilty in death of Odin LloydJudge has already barred prosecutors from using certain evidence""The universe of damning evidence has shrunk "" legal analyst says(CNN)Jurors in the murder trial of former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez are scheduled to hear attorneys' opening statements Thursday on whether the one-time NFL star worth $40 million killed a semipro football player.Hernandez 25 has pleaded not guilty in the 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd 27 who dated the sister of Hernandez's fiance.Two alleged accomplices Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz have also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately.An unexplained issue with a juror delayed the long-anticipated opening Thursday morning.How selecting a jury really works 02:10PLAY VIDEOShayanna Jenkins Hernandez's fiance entered the courtroom and sat in the first row on the left side. Next to her were the defendant's older brother DJ Hernandez and his mother Terri Hernandez.Ursula Ward Lloyd's mother arrived with five people and sat in the front row on the right side. Shaneah Jenkins the sister of Shayanna who dated Lloyd at the time of alleged murder sat with Ward.Hernandez was expressionless when he entered the courtroom.The Massachusetts case has taken on renewed attention because the Patriots are playing the Seattle Seahawks in Sunday's Super Bowl and because Patriots owner Bob Kraft and head coach Bill Belichick are on the prosecution's witness list.Days after Lloyd's slaying on June 17 2013 Hernandez went to Gillette Stadium in Foxboro Massachusetts and had conversations with Kraft and Belichick about Lloyd's death according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation.Both meetings were face to face and Kraft later told investigators that Hernandez said flat-out he had nothing to do with Lloyd's death the source told CNN.Photos: Rise and fall of Aaron Hernandez 12 photosEXPAND GALLERYAccording to Belichick the same was true and the head coach told authorities he spoke with Hernandez about his whereabouts the night of Lloyd's death the source added. The day Hernandez was arrested Belichick told reporters at a press conference he was shocked.Barred evidenceSince the former tight end was arrested and charged in Lloyd's death the prosecution's case has changed significantly seemingly in Hernandez's favor as the judge has barred prosecutors from using certain evidence legal analysts said.For example Judge Susan Garsh barred a text message from Lloyd to his sister sent minutes before he was killed. The message stated that he was with ""Nfl "" adding ""just so u know.""The judge ruled the message wasn't enough proof that Lloyd thought he was going to die.The defense argued the messages are innocuous suggesting Lloyd could have been bragging about being with Hernandez.The case against Aaron HernandezThe judge has also blocked any mention that Hernandez has been indicted in connection with two other killings in Boston. Hernandez pleaded not guilty in the shooting deaths of Ernesto Abreu and Safiro Furtado outside a bar in Boston in 2012 and a trial date hasn't yet been set in that case.Former NFL player charged with murder 02:51PLAY VIDEOThe judge has also barred one prosecution witness former Hernandez friend Alexander Bradley from stating he is suing Hernandez for allegedly shooting him in the right eye a few months before Lloyd's death. That shooting is inadmissible the judge ruled.""The universe of damning evidence has shrunk "" said legal analyst Michael McCann founding director of the Sports and Entertainment Law Institute at the University of New Hampshire.Also the murder weapon has not been found.""There is no murder weapon or a witness that credibly would testify that Aaron Hernandez did it. There is no such witness "" McCann said. ""It just isn't the slam dunk case that it seemed to be.""What's left for prosecutorsBut prosecutors have a lot of strong circumstantial evidence legal analysts said.Also prosecutors plan to argue Lloyd's killing was a ""joint venture."" Under Massachusetts state law prosecutors don't necessarily have to prove who pulled the trigger.Under joint venture ""anyone who actively participates in the murder can be held guilty for murder "" McCann said.Jury selection begins in Hernandez case 02:07PLAY VIDEO""If the jury believes that Aaron Hernandez was with Odin Lloyd right before he was killed it's not a big leap to conclude that Aaron Hernandez was involved in the murder of Odin Lloyd "" McCann added.Rising starDays after Lloyd's killing on June 17 2013 Hernandez left a crush of media camped outside his home and drove to Gillette Stadium to meet with the Patriots owner and head coach.At the time police sources were looking at Hernandez as someone who might have information about the killing after police found keys to a car rented by Hernandez on the body of Lloyd. His bullet-riddled remains were found at an industrial park in North Attleboro Massachusetts about a mile from the popular football player's home.Lloyd was dating Shaneah Jenkins the link between the young man who dreamed of the NFL and the pro player acquaintance who was scaling the league's summits.Shaneah Jenkins is the younger sister of Shayanna Jenkins who is engaged to Hernandez and the mother of his little girl. Two years ago Hernandez was one of the NFL's most promising tight ends signing a $40-million contract extension with the Patriots.Lloyd's last dayOn June 16 2013 Lloyd was riding with friends in a black Chevrolet Suburban which police later learned was rented by Hernandez.Close friend Daryl Hodge was with Lloyd when he said Lloyd got a text from Hernandez asking to hang out later that night.As they parted ways Lloyd told Hodge he'd see him later.The next day Lloyd's body was found.Remembering Odin Lloyd 5 photosEXPAND GALLERYProsecutors say Lloyd was last seen with Hernandez and Hernandez's two associates Ortiz and Wallace around 2:30 a.m. in a rented silver Nissan Altima.Surveillance video from security cameras at an industrial park showed an Altima heading toward a secluded area at 3:22 a.m.At the same time Lloyd's phone sent the text messages to his sister.Between 3:23 and 3:27 a.m. workers nearby reported hearing gunshots. At 3:29 a camera showed an Altima pulling into Hernandez's driveway about a half a mile from the death scene.Three people got out of the car and Lloyd was not one of them.Nine days later Hernandez was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and other weapon-related charges."37,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/02/20/winter-frosty-grip-to-tighten-even-more-across-portions-southeast-mid-atlantic/,Winter's frosty grip to tighten even more across portions of Southeast  Mid-Atlantic,"The sun rises above Lake Michigan Thursday morning Feb. 19 2015 in Chicago.

Harper said.""What it takes for guys to be good is to be constantly reminded of the principles and values of the fraternities to which they pledge themselves "" Harper said.A common strategy to disrupt improper behavior -- without breaking the shared brotherhood -- is to use the frat's stated values as a mirror.

They plan to portray Tamerlan as the mastermind of the attack. He died in a shootout with police days after the bombings.But prosecutors say Dzhokhar was an equal participant who acted of his own free will.

All we can do all you can do is make the best choice.""Jury to decide if Tsarnaev lives or dies 01:58PLAY VIDEOBruck told jurors there are only two punishments for them to choose from: death or life in prison without any possibility of parole.""We are asking you to punish Jahar by imprisoning him for the rest of his life.""Showing the court a photo of the federal Supermax prison in Colorado Bruck said:""He goes here and he's forgotten. No more spotlight like the death penalty brings.""No martyrdom. Just years and years of punishment day after day as he grows up to deal with the lonely struggle of dealing with what he did.""Tsarnaev 21 was convicted this month of all 30 counts against him; 17 of those counts carry the death penalty for the murders of four -- Krystle Campbell 29; Lingzi Lu 23; Martin Richard 8; and Sean Collier 26.In deciding whether the former college student is executed for his crimes or spends the rest of his days in a high-security federal prison jurors must weigh the heinousness of his crime and the toll on his victims against so-called mitigating factors such as his relative youth mental health and family background and whether or not he is remorseful.He has shown no emotion as he sits in court and he has avoided eye contact with maimed bombing survivors and relatives of the dead.Last week federal prosecutors presented three days of gut-wrenching victim impact testimony including an array of images showing the victims as happy active people and edited videos that added a soundtrack featuring a loud explosion screams and panicked voices to the horrific bombing scene outside the Forum restaurant where Richard and Lu died.Boston Marathon bomber flips the bird at camera 01:55PLAY VIDEOLead defense attorney Judy Clarke -- a nationally known death penalty opponent -- has acknowledged that Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan set off the bombs and shot MIT campus cop Collier. But she is expected to build a narrative showing her client as a puppet of his dominant older brother.Tamerlan Tsarnaev who was 26 died in a gunbattle with Watertown Massachusetts police three days after the bombings.Clarke's colleague Bruck began that narrative in his opening statement by noting ""The man who conceived planned and led this crime is beyond our power to punish. Only the 19-year-old younger brother who helped is left.""Several members of Tsarnaev's family arrived in Boston over the weekend but the defense is closely guarding its witness list. The relatives who are at an undisclosed location after being forced to leave a suburban hotel apparently do not include his parents who divorced and returned to Dagestan before the April 15 2013 bombings.Court filings indicate that the defense plans to call expert witness Janet Vogelsang a sociologist to explain Tsarnaev's difficult upbringing as the overlooked child of immigrants -- displaced Russian Muslims whose American dream failed.Under federal law the jury's decision must be unanimous. A deadlocked jury would result in an automatic life sentence for Tsarnaev -- which means the defense only needs to convince one juror to spare his life.The Boston Globe reported over the weekend that fewer than 20% of those polled in Massachusetts favor the death penalty for Tsarnaev. The number is down substantially since the days after the bombings."44,http://www.foxnews.com/weather/2015/03/03/blizzard-conditions-expected-for-parts-upper-midwest/,Blizzard conditions expected for parts of Upper Midwest,"Winter storm hits Midwest NortheastNever autoplay videosMINNEAPOLIS  Residents across the Upper Midwest may soon get the snowfall some have been wanting more of this winter.Heavy snow is expected Tuesday in parts of Minnesota Iowa Michigan North Dakota South Dakota and Wisconsin.A band from west-central to northeastern Minnesota could see the heaviest amounts 4-6 inches.

(AP Photo/The Boston Globe Aram Boghosian Pool)FALL RIVER Mass.  A state police trooper who specializes in fingerprint analysis testified Tuesday in the murder trial of Aaron Hernandez that the fingerprints of the former NFL player and his alleged victim Odin Lloyd were found inside a car that was allegedly used to drive Lloyd to his death.Prosecutors say Hernandez then a New England Patriots tight end and two friends Carlos Ortiz and Ernest Wallace picked up Lloyd from his home early on the morning of June 17 2013 shortly before he was killed.Massachusetts State Police Trooper David Mackin who processed the fingerprints found inside a Nissan Altima that Hernandez had rented testified that Lloyd's fingerprints were found on the handle of the rear passenger side door.Lloyd's sister testified Monday that she saw Lloyd get into the rear passenger side of a silver Nissan that night but could not see the driver. Video from a neighbor's surveillance camera also showed Lloyd getting into a car at 2:32 a.m. Prosecutors have said Lloyd was dead by 3:30 a.m. shot to death in an industrial park near Hernandez's home.Mackin testified that Hernandez's fingerprints were found on the inside handle of the driver's side. Surveillance footage from the night of the killing shows Hernandez getting into the driver's seat of a Nissan Altima which he had rented the previous week.The fingerprints of Ortiz and Wallace also were found inside the car Mackin said. Wallace's fingerprints were found in various places including on the inside driver's side window the driver's side seatbelt latch the front passenger inside door handle and the inside rear passenger door window. Ortiz's fingerprints were found on the rear passenger inside door handle.Ortiz and Wallace have also been charged with murder and have pleaded not guilty. They will be tried separately.Around 2 a.m. the day of Lloyd's slaying Hernandez and Ortiz were captured on video at a gas station south of Boston. It shows Hernandez putting gas in a Nissan Altima before entering the gas station and buying gum and cigars with Ortiz. They get back in the car with Hernandez in the driver's seat and Ortiz in the back. They leave at 2:12 a.m. Prosecutors have said the group then drives to Lloyd's home in the Dorchester section of Boston.During cross-examination Tuesday defense attorney James Sultan went after Mackin's credentials saying Mackin was not certified as a fingerprint expert.The defense has tried to paint a picture of a shoddy police investigation and it suggested that Mackin was on the prosecution's side.In other testimony Tuesday prosecutors showed the jury text messages that Hernandez sent to Lloyd hours before the shooting. In them Hernandez says he wants to meet with Lloyd.""I'm coming to grab that tonight u gon b around I need dat and we could step for a little again '' Hernandez wrote in one text to Lloyd at 9:05 p.m. on June 16. He sent more messages urging them to get together.A maid who cleaned Hernandez's home testified that she saw him ""messing with"" the security camera in his basement the day after the killing.Glaucia Santos said Tuesday that she was cleaning a bathroom when she heard Hernandez enter. She says she saw him touching the camera which is located on the basement's family room ceiling.During cross-examination defense attorney Michael Fee presented a layout of Hernandez's basement. He suggested that Santos couldn't have seen Hernandez or the camera from where she was.Santos could not say what Hernandez was doing with the camera.",http://us.cnn.com/2015/01/29/us/massachusetts-aaron-hernandez-trial/index.html,Jury to hear opening statements in murder trial of NFL's Aaron Hernandez,"Story highlightsFormer Patriot tight end Aaron Hernandez 25 has pleaded not guilty in death of Odin LloydJudge has already barred prosecutors from using certain evidence""The universe of damning evidence has shrunk "" legal analyst says(CNN)Jurors in the murder trial of former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez are scheduled to hear attorneys' opening statements Thursday on whether the one-time NFL star worth $40 million killed a semipro football player.Hernandez 25 has pleaded not guilty in the 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd 27 who dated the sister of Hernandez's fiance.Two alleged accomplices Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz have also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately.An unexplained issue with a juror delayed the long-anticipated opening Thursday morning.How selecting a jury really works 02:10PLAY VIDEOShayanna Jenkins Hernandez's fiance entered the courtroom and sat in the first row on the left side. Next to her were the defendant's older brother DJ Hernandez and his mother Terri Hernandez.Ursula Ward Lloyd's mother arrived with five people and sat in the front row on the right side. Shaneah Jenkins the sister of Shayanna who dated Lloyd at the time of alleged murder sat with Ward.Hernandez was expressionless when he entered the courtroom.The Massachusetts case has taken on renewed attention because the Patriots are playing the Seattle Seahawks in Sunday's Super Bowl and because Patriots owner Bob Kraft and head coach Bill Belichick are on the prosecution's witness list.Days after Lloyd's slaying on June 17 2013 Hernandez went to Gillette Stadium in Foxboro Massachusetts and had conversations with Kraft and Belichick about Lloyd's death according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation.Both meetings were face to face and Kraft later told investigators that Hernandez said flat-out he had nothing to do with Lloyd's death the source told CNN.Photos: Rise and fall of Aaron Hernandez 12 photosEXPAND GALLERYAccording to Belichick the same was true and the head coach told authorities he spoke with Hernandez about his whereabouts the night of Lloyd's death the source added. The day Hernandez was arrested Belichick told reporters at a press conference he was shocked.Barred evidenceSince the former tight end was arrested and charged in Lloyd's death the prosecution's case has changed significantly seemingly in Hernandez's favor as the judge has barred prosecutors from using certain evidence legal analysts said.For example Judge Susan Garsh barred a text message from Lloyd to his sister sent minutes before he was killed. The message stated that he was with ""Nfl "" adding ""just so u know.""The judge ruled the message wasn't enough proof that Lloyd thought he was going to die.The defense argued the messages are innocuous suggesting Lloyd could have been bragging about being with Hernandez.The case against Aaron HernandezThe judge has also blocked any mention that Hernandez has been indicted in connection with two other killings in Boston. Hernandez pleaded not guilty in the shooting deaths of Ernesto Abreu and Safiro Furtado outside a bar in Boston in 2012 and a trial date hasn't yet been set in that case.Former NFL player charged with murder 02:51PLAY VIDEOThe judge has also barred one prosecution witness former Hernandez friend Alexander Bradley from stating he is suing Hernandez for allegedly shooting him in the right eye a few months before Lloyd's death. That shooting is inadmissible the judge ruled.""The universe of damning evidence has shrunk "" said legal analyst Michael McCann founding director of the Sports and Entertainment Law Institute at the University of New Hampshire.Also the murder weapon has not been found.""There is no murder weapon or a witness that credibly would testify that Aaron Hernandez did it. There is no such witness "" McCann said. ""It just isn't the slam dunk case that it seemed to be.""What's left for prosecutorsBut prosecutors have a lot of strong circumstantial evidence legal analysts said.Also prosecutors plan to argue Lloyd's killing was a ""joint venture."" Under Massachusetts state law prosecutors don't necessarily have to prove who pulled the trigger.Under joint venture ""anyone who actively participates in the murder can be held guilty for murder "" McCann said.Jury selection begins in Hernandez case 02:07PLAY VIDEO""If the jury believes that Aaron Hernandez was with Odin Lloyd right before he was killed it's not a big leap to conclude that Aaron Hernandez was involved in the murder of Odin Lloyd "" McCann added.Rising starDays after Lloyd's killing on June 17 2013 Hernandez left a crush of media camped outside his home and drove to Gillette Stadium to meet with the Patriots owner and head coach.At the time police sources were looking at Hernandez as someone who might have information about the killing after police found keys to a car rented by Hernandez on the body of Lloyd. His bullet-riddled remains were found at an industrial park in North Attleboro Massachusetts about a mile from the popular football player's home.Lloyd was dating Shaneah Jenkins the link between the young man who dreamed of the NFL and the pro player acquaintance who was scaling the league's summits.Shaneah Jenkins is the younger sister of Shayanna Jenkins who is engaged to Hernandez and the mother of his little girl. Two years ago Hernandez was one of the NFL's most promising tight ends signing a $40-million contract extension with the Patriots.Lloyd's last dayOn June 16 2013 Lloyd was riding with friends in a black Chevrolet Suburban which police later learned was rented by Hernandez.Close friend Daryl Hodge was with Lloyd when he said Lloyd got a text from Hernandez asking to hang out later that night.As they parted ways Lloyd told Hodge he'd see him later.The next day Lloyd's body was found.Remembering Odin Lloyd 5 photosEXPAND GALLERYProsecutors say Lloyd was last seen with Hernandez and Hernandez's two associates Ortiz and Wallace around 2:30 a.m. in a rented silver Nissan Altima.Surveillance video from security cameras at an industrial park showed an Altima heading toward a secluded area at 3:22 a.m.At the same time Lloyd's phone sent the text messages to his sister.Between 3:23 and 3:27 a.m. workers nearby reported hearing gunshots. At 3:29 a camera showed an Altima pulling into Hernandez's driveway about a half a mile from the death scene.Three people got out of the car and Lloyd was not one of them.Nine days later Hernandez was arrested and charged with first-degree murder and other weapon-related charges."46,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/03/06/police-charge-2-brothers-in-philadelphia-officer-death/,Police charge 2 brothers in Philadelphia officer's death,PHILADELPHIA  Philadelphia's police commissioner says two brothers have been charged with murder in the death of an officer who was gunned down during a video game store robbery.Commissioner Charles Ramsey said Friday morning that one suspect is a 24-year-old with a prior arrest for aggravated assault.

Craven shot into the vehicle after reporting that Satterwhite had grabbed his gun during a confrontation. Satterwhite was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital.In a lawsuit Satterwhite's family ""vehemently denies"" that he ever tried to grab the officer's weapon according to The Washington Post.A grand jury indicted Craven on a misdemeanor charge of ""misconduct in office"" earlier this year -- a lesser charge than the manslaughter charge prosecutors had been seeking the Post reported.On Monday the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division announced Craven will now face the felony firearm charge which carries a maximum penalty of up to 10 years in prison and a $1 000 fine.According to an arrest affidavit the shooting was recorded on video and Craven admitted firing into the vehicle.Craven's attorney Jack Swerling told The Washington Post that his client plans to plead not guilty to both charges."48,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/02/26/houston-police-lone-gunman-linked-to-february-shootings-in-which-1-died-3/,Houston police: Lone gunman linked to February shootings in which 1 died  3 others injured,HOUSTON  Police are searching for a Houston-area gunman they believe is responsible for a series of shootings this month that left a man dead and three injured.

His body was found in an industrial park not far from Hernandez's home.A representative from Dallas-based AT&T has been going through Hernandez's cellphone records with prosecutors.AT&T's Christopher Ritchell testified Tuesday that according to their records Hernandez's cellphone did not communicate with the network for more than 20 hours in the time before and after Lloyd was killed.,http://us.cnn.com/2015/01/29/us/massachusetts-aaron-hernandez-trial/index.html,Jury to hear opening statements in murder trial of NFL's Aaron Hernandez,"Story highlightsFormer Patriot tight end Aaron Hernandez 25 has pleaded not guilty in death of Odin LloydJudge has already barred prosecutors from using certain evidence""The universe of damning evidence has shrunk "" legal analyst says(CNN)Jurors in the murder trial of former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez are scheduled to hear attorneys' opening statements Thursday on whether the one-time NFL star worth $40 million killed a semipro football player.Hernandez 25 has pleaded not guilty in the 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd 27 who dated the sister of Hernandez's fiance.Two alleged accomplices Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz have also pleaded not guilty and will be tried separately.An unexplained issue with a juror delayed the long-anticipated opening Thursday morning.How selecting a jury really works 02:10PLAY VIDEOShayanna Jenkins Hernandez's fiance entered the courtroom and sat in the first row on the left side. Next to her were the defendant's older brother DJ Hernandez and his mother Terri Hernandez.Ursula Ward Lloyd's mother arrived with five people and sat in the front row on the right side. Shaneah Jenkins the sister of Shayanna who dated Lloyd at the time of alleged murder sat with Ward.Hernandez was expressionless when he entered the courtroom.The Massachusetts case has taken on renewed attention because the Patriots are playing the Seattle Seahawks in Sunday's Super Bowl and because Patriots owner Bob Kraft and head coach Bill Belichick are on the prosecution's witness list.Days after Lloyd's slaying on June 17 2013 Hernandez went to Gillette Stadium in Foxboro Massachusetts and had conversations with Kraft and Belichick about Lloyd's death according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation.Both meetings were face to face and Kraft later told investigators that Hernandez said flat-out he had nothing to do with Lloyd's death the source told CNN.Photos: Rise and fall of Aaron Hernandez 12 photosEXPAND GALLERYAccording to Belichick the same was true and the head coach told authorities he spoke with Hernandez about his whereabouts the night of Lloyd's death the source added. The day Hernandez was arrested Belichick told reporters at a press conference he was shocked.Barred evidenceSince the former tight end was arrested and charged in Lloyd's death the prosecution's case has changed significantly seemingly in Hernandez's favor as the judge has barred prosecutors from using certain evidence legal analysts said.For example Judge Susan Garsh barred a text message from Lloyd to his sister sent minutes before he was killed. The message stated that he was with ""Nfl "" adding ""just so u know.""The judge ruled the message wasn't enough proof that Lloyd thought he was going to die.The defense argued the messages are innocuous suggesting Lloyd could have been bragging about being with Hernandez.The case against Aaron HernandezThe judge has also blocked any mention that Hernandez has been indicted in connection with two other killings in Boston.

That shooting is inadmissible the judge ruled.""The universe of damning evidence has shrunk "" said legal analyst Michael McCann founding director of the Sports and Entertainment Law Institute at the University of New Hampshire.Also the murder weapon has not been found.""There is no murder weapon or a witness that credibly would testify that Aaron Hernandez did it. There is no such witness "" McCann said. ""It just isn't the slam dunk case that it seemed to be.""What's left for prosecutorsBut prosecutors have a lot of strong circumstantial evidence legal analysts said.Also prosecutors plan to argue Lloyd's killing was a ""joint venture."" Under Massachusetts state law prosecutors don't necessarily have to prove who pulled the trigger.Under joint venture ""anyone who actively participates in the murder can be held guilty for murder "" McCann said.Jury selection begins in Hernandez case 02:07PLAY VIDEO""If the jury believes that Aaron Hernandez was with Odin Lloyd right before he was killed it's not a big leap to conclude that Aaron Hernandez was involved in the murder of Odin Lloyd "" McCann added.Rising starDays after Lloyd's killing on June 17 2013 Hernandez left a crush of media camped outside his home and drove to Gillette Stadium to meet with the Patriots owner and head coach.At the time police sources were looking at Hernandez as someone who might have information about the killing after police found keys to a car rented by Hernandez on the body of Lloyd. His bullet-riddled remains were found at an industrial park in North Attleboro Massachusetts about a mile from the popular football player's home.Lloyd was dating Shaneah Jenkins the link between the young man who dreamed of the NFL and the pro player acquaintance who was scaling the league's summits.Shaneah Jenkins is the younger sister of Shayanna Jenkins who is engaged to Hernandez and the mother of his little girl. Two years ago Hernandez was one of the NFL's most promising tight ends signing a $40-million contract extension with the Patriots.Lloyd's last dayOn June 16 2013 Lloyd was riding with friends in a black Chevrolet Suburban which police later learned was rented by Hernandez.Close friend Daryl Hodge was with Lloyd when he said Lloyd got a text from Hernandez asking to hang out later that night.As they parted ways Lloyd told Hodge he'd see him later.The next day Lloyd's body was found.Remembering Odin Lloyd 5 photosEXPAND GALLERYProsecutors say Lloyd was last seen with Hernandez and Hernandez's two associates Ortiz and Wallace around 2:30 a.m. in a rented silver Nissan Altima.Surveillance video from security cameras at an industrial park showed an Altima heading toward a secluded area at 3:22 a.m.At the same time Lloyd's phone sent the text messages to his sister.Between 3:23 and 3:27 a.m. workers nearby reported hearing gunshots.

Jahar scarred and maimed more than 250 others and changed countless lives forever.And even if his brother pulled the trigger Jahar shot a 26-year-old campus cop between the eyes a few days later because he wanted the cop's gun.The 13th JurorNo cameras are allowed at the Tsarnaev trial.

Will they demand retribution as well?Joe Kebartas has been a fixture outside the courthouse every day of the Tsarnaev trial.EXPAND IMAGEJoe Kebartas a 66-year-old retiree from South Boston hopes not. A Vietnam veteran and former mental health worker Kebartas stood in front of the John Joseph Moakley U.S. Courthouse every morning of Tsarnaev's trial. He held a simple sign written by hand on poster board: ""Death Penalty is Murder.""The word ""Murder"" was lettered in red the color of blood.Along with the construction crews bomb-sniffing dogs and line of television cameras Kebartas became part of the daily scene on the courthouse sidewalk. He was there when the snow was up past his knees. He was there in the rain and sleet. On most days he stood alone.But now that the case is entering the penalty phase Kebartas said he expects he'll see some company -- like the man in the mariachi hat who joined him the other day. Some of them will come from an interfaith group called Pax Christi. Kebartas a devout Catholic is a member of the group and shares its strong opposition to the death penalty.Judy Clarke and other defense attorneys walk past Kerbartas as they arrive at federal court Wednesday.EXPAND IMAGETsarnaev's attorneys exchanged nods and smiles with Kebartas as they strode into court on Wednesday. The defense lawyers Clarke and David Bruck greet him like a kindred spirit. It's a daily routine for the nationally prominent death penalty opponents.Their opposition to the death penalty is why Clarke and Bruck take on clients like Jahar Tsarnaev. But a few hours after they waved at Kebartas they learned for certain what they had suspected all along: They had their work cut out for them.The jury found Tsarnaev guilty of all 30 counts against him including 17 that offer just two options for punishment: life in prison or the death penalty.Clarke has been able to save some of America's most notorious criminals from the death chamber: Unabomber Ted Kaczynski who recently told Vanity Fair's Mark Bowden she was a ""sicko;"" Aryan Nation member Buford Furrow who threatened her life; Zacarias Moussaoui who shouted ""death to America"" and vowed to kill everyone at his trial; Olympic bomber Eric Rudolph; and Jared Loughner who shot U.S. Rep.

Tsarnaev may be her first death row client.Massachusetts is not the sort of place where one would expect that to happen. The state banned capital punishment a generation ago but Tsarnaev has been convicted under federal law. Massachusetts opinion polls have been pretty consistent: About two-thirds of the people surveyed oppose capital punishment and think Tsarnaev should instead spend the rest of his days behind bars.He survived a shootout with police in Watertown in which he and his brother were outgunned 210 rounds to 56. He survived another fusillade of bullets into the boat where he was hiding.As one unsuccessful jury prospect put it: ""How many thousands of rounds did you fire into that boat and you couldn't kill him? I'm not going to kill him for you now.""Life or death for Boston bomber? 02:08PLAY VIDEOSome of the people chosen for Tsarnaev's jury said they had reservations about the death penalty. It's not something that's talked about much here because it usually isn't an issue in Massachusetts.But each person on the jury is there because he or she agreed to override personal opinions and follow the law.The next step will strip a lot of personal opinion out of the process. Jurors instead will be asked to weigh what they hear from others. They will probably hear victim impact statements from bombing survivors and families of the three people killed. They are also likely to hear a little about Tsarnaev's family background and school history.The parties' witness lists have not been made public and a behind-the-scenes battle appears to be brewing over a social worker the defense hopes to call. They want her to narrate the Tsarnaev family's story of political and religious strife in Russia their immigration to America their struggle to assimilate and ultimately the parents' divorce and return to their homeland when their dream of a better life failed.Boston bombing survivor: No closure but will 'move on' 01:32PLAY VIDEOTsarnaev has yet to express remorse or much of anything. In court he is a blank. He doesn't carry or read from a Quran. Instead he doodles. He doesn't appear to pray.

Although many have speculated over whether he will testify I wonder if he even can.His boat hideout was pocked with bullets and streaked with his blood. His head and hands were bloody when he emerged from the boat. But so far there has been no discussion of his injuries at the trial.But earlier in the case Dr. Stephen Odom who treated him before his bedside arraignment at Israel Deaconess Medical Center said Tsarnaev had multiple gunshot wounds including one that injured his mouth and lower face. It was a ""high-powered injury"" that fractured the base of his skull shattered a bone in his neck and injured his mouth and pharynx.It is possible he suffered a concussion or other brain injury Odom said in a transcript that had been under seal.Survivor: I won't lose sleep over him being put to death 02:47PLAY VIDEOIndeed a large scar is visible in court running behind Tsarnev's left ear and down his neck. His left eyebrow seems permanently raised as if by paralysis or nerve damage.He enters and leaves the courtroom stiffly with a slight limp. But it's still possible to detect traces of the college boy strut he displayed while picking out a half gallon of milk at a Whole Foods Market about 20 minutes after the bombs went off.""It's a horrible crime there's no doubt about that "" said Kebartas standing outside the courthouse with his anti-death penalty sign.""According to what was written in the boat he was committing this crime because of what the U.S. was doing to the Muslims in the Mideast and retribution "" he said.Punishing Tsarnaev with the death penalty ""doesn't solve anything "" he added. ""For a criminal to commit to a crime a murder and then for the state to lower itself to murder the murderer -- that's a crime itself.

Protesters called for calm but vowed to keep pushing for change in Ferguson a day after the shooting of two officers in front of the city's police department heightened tensions in the St. Louis suburb.Dozens gathered for a candlelight vigil Thursday night where they expressed sympathy for the wounded officers. They also prayed for peace as Ferguson moves forward in the wake of a scathing Justice Department report on racial bias in its law-enforcement practices.A larger crowd of about 200 protesters gathered later outside the police department but the scene was a marked contrast to the previous night when fights broke out before the shootings.Some called for specific changes: the resignation of Ferguson's mayor or the disbanding of the police department. Others were there to remember 18-year-old Michael Brown whose shooting death by a Ferguson police officer in August made the city a national focal point.""We'll not be derailed in the pursuit of justice by anybody or anything that wants to get in our way "" said the Rev. Traci Blackmon a member of the state's Ferguson Commission who led the prayer vigil at a public plaza in downtown Ferguson near the police department. ""We refuse to stop.""Officers from the St. Louis County Police Department and the Missouri Highway Patrol were summoned to bolster security but largely stood idle in the distance. The protesters had largely disbanded by 11:30 p.m. No arrests were made.The shootings just after midnight on Thursday came as protesters had gathered after the resignation of the city's embattled police chief. They marked the first time in more than seven months of tension in Ferguson that officers were shot at a protest and the bloodshed threatened to inflame the already fraught relationship between police and demonstrators.Both wounded officers were released from the hospital Thursday but St. Louis County Police Chief Jon Belmar -- who called the attack an ambush -- said they could have been killed. One was shot in the right shoulder the bullet exiting through his back. The other in the right cheek just below the eye. The bullet lodged behind his ear.Several people were taken in for questioning but were later released and no arrests were made by late Thursday. The shots were believed to come from a handgun across the street from the police department.The gunman may have fired from up to 120 yards away a distance longer than a football field. But with a line of roughly 20 officers standing in front of the building the shooter did not have to be particularly accurate to hit two of them Belmar said.In Washington President Barack Obama took to Twitter to relay his prayers to the officers and to denounce violence against police. ""Path to justice is one all of us must travel together "" Obama wrote signing the tweet with his initials to indicate the president personally composed it.Attorney General Eric Holder said the gunman was ""a damn punk"" who was ""trying to sow discord in an area that was trying to get its act together trying to bring together a community that had been fractured for too long.""In a statement Ferguson Mayor James Knowles III and the city council said that although they respect the right to protest peacefully ""we cannot continue to move forward under threats of violence and destruction to our community. We ask our residents and clergy in this area to partner with us as we make our way through this process.""The calls for healing and reconciliation weren't received favorably by all. As participants gathered before the prayer vigil Thursday night shouts of ""white power"" came from a passing pickup truck.Brown's August shooting by former Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson prompted protests locally and across the nation and tensions escalated in November after a county grand jury declined to prosecute Wilson. Justice Department investigators concurred with that finding in a report released March 4.The Justice Department also released a separate report that day that found racial profiling in the city police force and a municipal court system driven by profit largely on the backs of black and low-income residents.Police Chief Tom Jackson's resignation on Wednesday marked the sixth departure or firing in the week since the release of that report. Ferguson's court clerk was fired and the municipal judge two police officers and the city manager voluntarily stepped aside. Wilson resigned in November.

Officers attempted ""voice commands and low level force "" and used a Taser police said but those efforts were unsuccessful.After two officers were struck with rocks -- at least one of them as large as a softball -- police said the officers resorted to deadly force.The family of Zambrano-Montes has filed a $25 million claim against the city of Pasco alleging that three officers killed the unarmed man ""execution style.""The suit claims Zambrano-Montes was unarmed ""with his hands out where they could be seen.""""He had his back to the officers "" the claim said.

It is miraculous that my client isn't dead "" said attorney Michelle Cohen-Metzger.The incident was recorded February 19 on the dashcam of two Marana police cars that were following the suspect 36-year-old Mario Valencia.In one video an officer who was tailing Valencia at slow speed reports over the radio that the suspect has fired one round in the air with a rifle he is accused of stealing that morning from a Walmart.Another patrol car zooms past runs into the man from behind then hits a short cinder block wall next to a driveway. Video from Officer Michael Rapiejko's camera shows the officer running the man over and the windshield smashing as the car hits the wall.""Oh Jesus Christ. Man down "" the officer in the first car says.Police in Marana which is about a half-hour from Tucson have justified Rapiejko's actions.""If we're going to choose between maybe we'll let him go a little bit farther and see what happens or we're going to take him out now and eliminate any opportunity he has to hurt somebody you're going to err on the side of in favor of the innocent people "" Police Chief Terry Rozema said.

The nude photos include some women who are asleep or passed out.""I can't imagine anybody that's not appalled by the alleged behavior "" Barron said in an interview on Wednesday.The national leaders of Kappa Delta Rho suspended the Penn State chapter for a year Tuesday over the photo controversy.State College police are also investigating allegations the fraternity controlled a private Facebook page n which members shared frat house pictures of the women. The invitation-only page had around 144 active members including students and alumni a warrant said.The photos showed women in sexual or embarrassing positions police said. Some of the women did not seem to be aware photos were being taken of them.Barron said the university is working with police to determine the number of offenders and victims.""This is the kind of behavior that can get someone expelled "" he said.Police have said they have identified at least two photographs that could lead to criminal charges but the investigation is continuing.A young man who answered the door on Tuesday at Kappa Delta Rho said the fraternity had no comment. No-trespassing signs were posted there on Wednesday.Penn States main campus in State College has nearly 40 000 undergraduate students. About 4 000 belong to one of the 50 fraternities on campus.Barron speaking to reporters at the state Capitol in Harrisburg was asked about whether the fraternity system as a whole needs to be reviewed. He said the focus should be on dealing with people who act inappropriately not targeting the system. ""I think if you punish those that are responsible we all learn and if you punish everybody then I don't think we really all learn "" he said.A former fraternity member tipped police off about the photos in January and shared printouts of some of the pictures.Police said anyone who posted the photos could face misdemeanor charges of harassment or invasion of privacy with a fine being the most likely penalty.

She said the only acceptable response is to expel -- not suspend as that would send the wrong message -- all the students involved.""I was hurt that my fellow peers that I walk to class with every day people that I see every day could say such hateful things about me and my culture about my friends about my brothers and my sisters "" she said.'Racism is alive'Unheard posted the video online Sunday with the comment ""Racism is alive at The University of Oklahoma.""

U.S. and European diplomats for their part hold that sanctions should only be lifted once Tehran accounts for its past nuclear activity and is confirmed to be using nuclear energy for peaceful means by the United Nations' nuclear watchdog. One European diplomat was quoted by the Journal as saying there was ""no way"" Western negotiators would budge from their position which the diplomat said the Iranians considered a ""deal-breaker. They don't want it at all."" Amid the dispute officials from Iran and the U.S. reportedly said Friday that talks will resume next week. According to the Journal both sides believe that the U.S. and European Union can lift some of the sanctions each has unilaterally imposed on Iran's energy and finance sectors. However the issue of lifting sanctions imposed by the U.N. is more complex and according to negotiators is likely to take years not weeks or months to accomplish. For its part the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) says that Iran has failed to turn over key documents about its nuclear program and has also denied access to scientists and nuclear sites. Both sides are working to meet a March 31 deadline to construct the framework of a permanent agreement. The final deadline for all the details to be worked out is June 30. On Thursday U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterpart Foreign Minister Javad Zarif met face-to-face for the fourth straight day in Lausanne Switzerland.The Associated Press reported late Thursday that elements of a draft deal had been agreed that would commit Iran to a 40 percent cut in the number of machines it could use to make an atomic bomb. In return the Iranians would get quick relief from some crippling economic sanctions and a partial lift of a U.N. embargo on conventional arms.Officials told the AP that the tentative deal imposes at least a decade of new limits on the number of centrifuges Iran can operate to enrich uranium a process that can lead to nuclear weapons-grade material. The sides are zeroing in on a cap of 6 000 centrifuges officials said down from the 6 500 they spoke of in recent weeks.That's also fewer than the 10 000 such machines Tehran now runs yet substantially more than the 500 to 1 500 that Washington originally wanted as a ceiling. Only a year ago U.S. officials floated 4 000 as a possible compromise.It's unclear how complete the draft is. Iran's deeply buried underground enrichment plant remains a problem officials said with Washington demanding the facility be repurposed and Tehran insisting it be able to run hundreds of centrifuges there. Iran says it wants to use the machines for scientific research; the Americans fear they could be quickly retooled for enrichment.A planned heavy water reactor will be re-engineered to produce much less plutonium than originally envisioned relieving concerns that it could be an alternative pathway to a bomb. U.S. officials believe they can extend the time Tehran would need to produce a nuclear weapon to at least a year. Right now Iran would require only two to three months to amass enough material to make a bomb.President Barack Obama appealed directly to Iranian citizens in a message commemorating Nowruz the Persian New Year.""Our negotiations have made progress but gaps remain "" Obama said Thursday in a video message posted online.""If Iran's leaders can agree to a reasonable deal it can lead to a better path the path of greater opportunities for the Iranian people "" he said.The pressure in Congress on the administration over Iran remained intense with the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee saying he would move ahead with legislation giving lawmakers a say over any nuclear deal. And 360 House Republicans and Democrats more than enough to override any presidential veto sent a letter to Obama saying if an agreement is reached Congress will decide on easing sanctions it has imposed.""Congress must be convinced that its terms foreclose any pathway to a bomb and only then will Congress be able to consider permanent sanctions relief "" the lawmakers wrote.Rep. Eliot Engel of New York the top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee told administration officials at a hearing Thursday that Congress cannot be marginalized and ""any attempts to sidestep Congress will be resisted on both sides of the aisle.""The Associated Press contributed to this report.

After the captain knocked on the door to get back into the cockpit the plane began its descent prompting an alarm to sound.Sondheimer never heard a response from Lubitz as the aircraft flew into the ravine.The full transcript has yet to be publicly released the newspaper reports. The black box captures up to two hours of the pilots conversations as well as other cockpit noises.Saturday the Wall Street Journal reported that Lubitzs eye difficulties were serious enough to ground him. Investigators told the paper that the 26-year-old had been examined by an eye specialist and that the appointments appeared to have taken place at University Hospital Dusseldorf.The paper said evidence uncovered during searches of Lubitzs apartment and his parents home indicated he had his eyes examined and was being treated for depression.The Journal said the 27-year-old Lubitz was being seen by a neuropsychologist for depression. The doctor gave Lubitz a note excusing him from the work the day of the crash but he ignored the advice and reported to work the paper said citing its source a person familiar with the investigation.German prosecutors reported Friday that Lubitz shredded the doctors notes for the day of the crash and other days supporting their assessment that Lubitz hid his medical illness from his employer and colleagues. They refused to say if the hidden illness was depression.The Journal said that while Lubitz had sought to conceal his mental illness there was no evidence that the fear of losing his medical classification as being fit to fly triggered his actions though this would be a plausible explanation the person said.His pilot's license is up for renewal in July and would be in jeopardy if he was diagnosed as mentally ill.The person told the Journal there was no evidence Lubitz was taking mind-altering medication that could have affected his judgment in the cockpit.When someone makes the same decision five or six times all leading toward one specific end you have to assume they are acting intentionally the person told the paper alluding to Mr. Lubitzs lack of reaction when urged by the pilot to open the locked cockpit door. Prosecutors said the cockpit voice recorder showed Lubitz breathing normally in the last moments of the flight even as the pilot tried to get back into the cockpit and passengers screamed for their lives.The Journal quoted a Lufthansa spokesman as saying: All we know was that he had a clean background.Dusseldorf prosecutor Christoph Kumpa said Friday the doctor's note for the day of the crash indicated Lubitz ""was declared by a medical doctor unfit to work.""Bild on Friday said Lubitz had been designated as ""not suitable for flying"" by his instructors at Lufthansa's training school in Arizona around the time that he halted his pursuit of a pilot's license in 2009.The tabloid said Lubitz spent 18 months receiving psychiatric treatment was diagnosed with a ""severe depressive episode "" and received what it called a ""special regular medical examination.""Neighbors described a man whose physical health was superb and road race records show Lubitz took part in several long-distance runs.Prosecutors said there was no indication of any political or religious motivation for Lubitz's actions on the Barcelona-Dusseldorf flight.The Associated Press contributed to this report.",http://us.cnn.com/2015/04/01/europe/france-germanwings-plane-crash-main/index.html,Prosecutor denies reports of cell phone video from inside Germanwings crash plane,"Story highlightsLufthansa CEO promises to help victims' families for as long as needed as he visits crash siteMarseille prosecutor says ""so far no videos were used in the crash investigation"" despite media reportsJournalists at Bild and Paris Match are ""very confident"" a video clip is real an editor saysMarseille France (CNN)The French prosecutor leading an investigation into the crash of Germanwings Flight 9525 insisted Wednesday that he was not aware of any video footage from on board the plane.Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin told CNN that ""so far no videos were used in the crash investigation.""He added ""A person who has such a video needs to immediately give it to the investigators.""Robin's comments follow claims by two publications German daily Bild and French Paris Match of a cell phone video showing the harrowing final seconds from on board Germanwings Flight 9525 as it crashed into the French Alps on March 24.

""But there is no mental illness that explains why somebody then feels entitled to also take that rage and turn it outward on 149 other people who had nothing to do with the person's problems.""Who was the captain of Germanwings Flight 9525?"63,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/04/01/man-who-sued-ex-nfler-aaron-hernandez-over-florida-shooting-due-to-take-stand/,Man who sued ex-NFLer Aaron Hernandez over Florida shooting due to take stand in murder trial,Former New England Patriots football player Aaron Hernandez left listens alongside his attorney Charles Rankin during his murder trial Tuesday March 31 2015 at Bristol County Superior Court in Fall River Mass.

Shaneah Jenkins the sister of Shayanna who dated Lloyd at the time of alleged murder sat with Ward.Hernandez was expressionless when he entered the courtroom.The Massachusetts case has taken on renewed attention because the Patriots are playing the Seattle Seahawks in Sunday's Super Bowl and because Patriots owner Bob Kraft and head coach Bill Belichick are on the prosecution's witness list.Days after Lloyd's slaying on June 17 2013 Hernandez went to Gillette Stadium in Foxboro Massachusetts and had conversations with Kraft and Belichick about Lloyd's death according to a law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation.Both meetings were face to face and Kraft later told investigators that Hernandez said flat-out he had nothing to do with Lloyd's death the source told CNN.Photos: Rise and fall of Aaron Hernandez 12 photosEXPAND GALLERYAccording to Belichick the same was true and the head coach told authorities he spoke with Hernandez about his whereabouts the night of Lloyd's death the source added. The day Hernandez was arrested Belichick told reporters at a press conference he was shocked.Barred evidenceSince the former tight end was arrested and charged in Lloyd's death the prosecution's case has changed significantly seemingly in Hernandez's favor as the judge has barred prosecutors from using certain evidence legal analysts said.For example Judge Susan Garsh barred a text message from Lloyd to his sister sent minutes before he was killed. The message stated that he was with ""Nfl "" adding ""just so u know.""The judge ruled the message wasn't enough proof that Lloyd thought he was going to die.The defense argued the messages are innocuous suggesting Lloyd could have been bragging about being with Hernandez.The case against Aaron HernandezThe judge has also blocked any mention that Hernandez has been indicted in connection with two other killings in Boston.

There is no such witness "" McCann said. ""It just isn't the slam dunk case that it seemed to be.""What's left for prosecutorsBut prosecutors have a lot of strong circumstantial evidence legal analysts said.Also prosecutors plan to argue Lloyd's killing was a ""joint venture.""

A knife with a 3-inch blade was found under the bed.'Covered in blood'Searching the split-level home police found several bloody towels being laundered in the washing machine.David Ridley the 35-year-old husband of Dynel Lane told police he had returned home earlier after leaving work to meet his wife.As the husband walked downstairs toward the basement his wife walked around the corner ""covered in blood "" the police report said.""She told David she just miscarried and the baby was in the bathtub upstairs "" the police report said.A baby in the bathtubAfter Ridley saw his bloody wife he ran to the bathroom and found ""a small baby lying in the bathtub "" the police report said.""He rubbed the baby slightly then rolled it over to ... see it take a gasping breath "" the report said.Ridley wrapped the baby in a towel and apparently unaware that its mother was still bleeding inside the house drove the baby and his wife to the emergency room of Longmont United Hospital police said.A 'well performed' incisionWilkins was later taken for treatment at the same hospital police said.The emergency room surgeon noticed the victim had an incision on her abdomen that ""appeared to be well performed "" the report said.The doctor observed that ""the person who did the incision would have to have researched the subject of cesarean births in books or online to achieve the level of accuracy "" the police report said.Lane was a certified nurse aide starting July 1 2010 and her license expired on January 31 2012 with no history of discipline or board actions according to records with the Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies. At that time she lived in Pueblo Colorado the records showed.No signs of giving birthWhile at the hospital with Lane a police investigator ""saw no visual signs of vaginal bleeding coming from Dynel or any signs of having recently given birth "" police said.Lane refused to allow hospital staff to examine her vaginally according to police.""Dynel admitted to Detective Stacey Graham that she cut abdomen open to remove [the victim's] baby "" according to the police report.The hospital told police ""the baby was approximately 7 months old and would have been viable "" the report said.Police then obtained a warrant to search Lane's body. The findings of that search weren't revealed Thursday.Suggestions of another lost pregnancyLane had told her family months earlier that she was pregnant even showing them an ultrasound photo of a boy in December.Her husband's early departure from work was to take her to a prenatal appointment police said.But one of Lane's two teenage daughters later told investigators that ""she could not tell Dynel was pregnant and [she] was very petite.""When asked Thursday whether Lane may have earlier lost a pregnancy prosecutors said they couldn't comment.""I can tell you we're looking very thoroughly at Ms. Lane's history and the police are investigating every aspect "" Boulder County District Attorney Stanley L.

The parents of Michael Alexander Cruz were listed as Jason and Dynel Cruz.A murder?Prosecutors are weighing whether to file a murder charge against Lane who won't face any formal charges until next week at the earliest Garnett said.The prosecutor described the difficulty in determining charges.""The issue of whether or not murder charges are appropriate involving a case involving the death of a fetus or a late-term pregnancy is always a difficult issue "" Garnett said.""Under Colorado law essentially there's no way murder charges can be brought if it's not established that the fetus lived as a child outside the body of the mother for some period of time. I don't know the answer yet as to whether that can be established what our facts are here "" Garnett said.That information will be a key part of the investigation Garnett said.Dozens of officers are working the case and awaiting medical information from an autopsy Garnett added.The definition of ""lived as a child"" is difficult too and whether that means one breath or one hour Garnett said.""The Supreme Court and the court of appeals will get to tell us that eventually.

Negotiations resumed in Switzerland on Wednesday but were almost immediately beset by competing claims just hours after diplomats abandoned a March 31 deadline to reach the outline of a deal and agreed to press on. And as the latest round hit the week mark three of the six foreign ministers involved left the talks with prospects for agreement remaining uncertain. Amid the confusion Sen. Tom Cotton R-Ark. told Fox News he's concerned the framework of a deal could allow Iran keep its uranium stockpiles and continue to enrich uranium in an underground bunker. ""You have to be willing to walk away from the table and to reapply leverage to Iran "" Cotton said. ""And the fact that they're not willing to do that that we're still sitting in Switzerland negotiating when three of our negotiating partners have already left just demonstrates to Iran that they can continue to demand dangerous concessions from the West."" Speaking on MSNBC former Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean seemed to agree. He said that while President Obama is ""right"" to seek a deal it might be time to ""step away"" from the table and make clear that the U.S. is not backing off key positions -- including on Iran's uranium stockpile and the pace of sanctions relief. More on this...Iran backs away from uranium concession ahead of deadline""I am worried about this "" Dean said. Rep. Martha McSally R-Ariz. also told Fox News ""we're potentially [legitimizing] them having a nuclear infrastructure."" She added: ""We don't know exactly what's behind closed doors."" Despite all sides agreeing to blow by their deadline in pursuit of a rough agreement even the White House threatened to abandon the talks if Iran wouldn't budge. ""If they're unwilling to make those kinds of commitments that give us that assurance and by us I mean not just the United States. I mean the international community then we'll have to walk away from the negotiating table and consider what other options may be available to us and there is certainly the possibility that that could happen "" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday. On Tuesday negotiators had been trying to agree to simply a joint statement that could justify talks continuing until a final June deadline. Iran's deputy foreign minister Abbas Araghchi told reporters that if the sides make progress on the text of a joint statement then that could be issued by the end of the day. But he suggested the statement would contain no specifics. A senior western official quickly pushed back saying that nothing about a statement had been decided and that Iran's negotiating partners would not accept a document that contained no details. The German Foreign Ministry tweeted that ""nothing is agreed "" although ""progress is visible."" Araghchi named differences on sanctions relief on his country as one dispute along with disputes on Iran's uranium enrichment-related research and development. ""Definitely our research and development program on high-end centrifuges should continue "" he told Iranian television. The U.S. and its negotiating partners want to crimp Iranian efforts to improve the performance of centrifuges that enrich uranium because advancing the technology could let Iran produce material that could be used to arm a nuclear weapon much more quickly than at present. The exchanges reflected significant gaps between the sides and came shortly after the end of the first post-deadline meeting between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry his British and German counterparts and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif in the Swiss town of Lausanne. They and their teams were continuing a marathon effort to bridge still significant gaps and hammer out a framework accord that would serve as the basis for a final agreement by the end of June. Eager to avoid a collapse in the discussions the United States and others claimed late Tuesday that enough progress had been made to warrant an extension after six days of intense bartering. But the foreign ministers of China France and Russia all departed Lausanne overnight although the significance of their absence was not clear. Kerry postponed his planned Tuesday departure to stay in Lausanne and an Iranian negotiator said his team would stay ""as long as necessary"" to clear the remaining hurdles. Officials say their intention is to produce a joint statement outlining general political commitments to resolving concerns about Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. In addition they are trying to fashion other documents that would lay out in more detail the steps they must take by June 30 to meet those goals. The additional documents would allow the sides to make the case that the next round of talks will not simply be a continuation of negotiations that have already been twice extended since an interim agreement between Iran the United States Russia China Britain France and Germany was concluded in November 2013. Obama and other leaders including Iran's have said they are not interested in a third extension. But if the parties agree only to a broad framework that leaves key details unresolved Obama can expect stiff opposition at home from members of Congress who want to move forward with new stiffer Iran sanctions. Lawmakers had agreed to hold off on such a measure through March while the parties negotiated. The White House says new sanctions would scuttle further diplomatic efforts to contain Iran's nuclear work and possibly lead Israel to act on threats to use military force to accomplish that goal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continued to question the course of talks on Wednesday. He said Iran views Israel's destruction as non-negotiable ""but evidently giving Iran's murderous regime a clear path to the bomb is negotiable. This is unconscionable "" he said. ""At the same time Iran is accelerating its campaign of terror subjugation and conquest throughout the region most recently in Yemen."" Netanyahu said a better deal would ""significantly roll back Iran's nuclear infrastructure"" and link a lifting of restrictions on its nuclear program to ""a change in Iran's behavior.""

(AP Photo/Jane Flavell Collins File) (The Associated Press)BOSTON  With one last chance to connect with the jury lawyers for Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev are expected to continue to portray him as an aimless college student who fell under the domineering influence of his radicalized older brother.But prosecutors are sure to remind the jury of the brutality of the attack the people who were maimed or killed and the image of Tsarnaev standing behind 8-year-old Martin Richard and his family about a minute before the blasts. The boy was one of three people killed when Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan placed two pressure-cooker bombs near the marathon finish line on April 15 2013.Closing arguments in the guilt phase of the trial are scheduled for Monday.Tsarnaev's lawyer admitted he participated in the bombings during her opening statement to the jury. ""It was him "" said attorney Judy Clarke a renowned death penalty lawyer.But Clarke told the jury that it was Tamerlan Tsarnaev who was the mastermind of the attack. Clarke said the 26-year-old had become increasingly radicalized and enlisted Dzhokhar then 19 to help him in an attack meant to retaliate against the U.S. for its actions in Muslim countries.Legal analysts said they expect the defense to stick with a strategy of conceding guilt but trying to persuade the jury that because Tsarnaev was not the driving force behind the attack they should spare him from the death penalty and instead sentence him to life in prison during the second phase of the trial. The same jury will be asked to decide his punishment.During the trial the defense used its four witnesses to show that Tamerlan Tsarnaev had searched for bomb components on his computer while Dzhokhar's computer activity focused largely on Facebook a Russian version of Facebook and other social media sites. The defense also called an FBI fingerprint investigator who said Tamerlan's fingerprints were found on some of the bomb parts recovered at the scene of the marathon bombing while Dzhokhar's were not.""They will continue to downplay his role and play up the role of his older brother trying to create the impression that his older brother was the puppeteer and he was the puppet "" said Christopher Dearborn a professor at Suffolk University Law School.""I don't think they have any hope of prevailing in the guilt phase but their strategy will continue to be to gain some credibility with the jury by conceding what they had to concede and hoping to try to humanize the kid a little bit so that will carry over into the second phase of the trial "" he said.Prosecutors told the jury that Tsarnaev and his brother were partners in the attack. They called witnesses who described how he joined his brother at a New Hampshire firing range to practice shooting about a month before the marathon had fireworks that had been emptied of their explosive powder in his dorm room and scrawled a message inside the boat he was captured in denouncing the U.S. for its wars in Muslim countries.They also called survivors of the bombing who gave heart-wrenching testimony about having legs blown off in the explosions.""I think the prosecution will remind the jury how horrendous this event was and they will further remind the jury that this fellow was a terrorist "" said Boston College Law School professor Robert Bloom.To rebut the defense claim that Dzhokhar was merely a follower of his brother prosecutors also will likely remind the jury that he is shown in surveillance video and still photos carrying a backpack and then with the backpack at his feet on the sidewalk behind the Richard family as well as other children.""The prosecution might say something to the effect of `He didn't do as much as his brother but he did plenty ""' Bloom said.",http://us.cnn.com/2015/04/07/us/boston-marathon-bombing-trial/index.html,Boston bombing trial: Jurors begin deliberations,"Story highlightsJurors began deliberations Tuesday morningIf Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is found guilty of at least one capital count trial will go to penalty phaseProsecutor in closing argument: Tsarnaev ""wanted to awake the mujahedeen the holy warriors""Boston (CNN)After weeks of dramatic and emotionally wrenching testimony jurors began deliberations Tuesday in the trial of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.The 21-year-old accused Boston Marathon bomber faces life in prison or the death penalty.On Monday the jury saw a video of the moment a bomb exploded and disemboweled an 8-year-old boy and ripped the leg off his sister. The blast killed a 23-year-old graduate student from China. The jurors heard more horror from April 15 2013.

The younger man Clarke said was only following his older brother.""If not for Tamerlan it would not have happened "" Clarke argued.Bomb survivors and victims' family members wiped away tears and comforted one another in court.Tsarnaev fidgeted at the defense table as he has done throughout the trial.Bill Richard father of bomb victim Martin Richard 8 craned his neck to watch Tsarnaev as the prosecutor spoke.Reporter: Jury may think life sentence worse than death 03:36PLAY VIDEODzhokhar Tsarnaev ""chose a day when the eyes of the world would be on Boston "" Chakravarty said.

They were the mujahedeen and they were bringing their battle to Boston.""The counts and possible consequencesTsarnaev is accused of 30 counts including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism. Seventeen of those counts carry a sentence of death or life imprisonment.If Tsarnaev is found guilty of at least one of the 17 capital counts the trial will proceed to a second phase the so-called penalty phase.That part of the trial will include evidence of aggravating and mitigating factors and the jury will be asked to weigh elements that make this crime especially heinous against details from Tsarnaev's background and mental health history that would weigh in his favor.Jury to begin deliberations on Tsarnaev's fate 02:15PLAY VIDEOSince testimony began March 4 federal prosecutors have called 92 witnesses and the defense just four.

He identified that person as Tamerlan Tsarnaev.Police fired 210 rounds at the brothers when they tracked a GPS device in Meng's stolen Mercedes and cornered them in Watertown Massachusetts. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev struck Tamerlan who was wounded when he charged police in the car. Tamerlan died of his injuries.""Tamerlan wanted suicide by cop "" the prosecutor said Monday. ""He was ready for heaven. But the defendant had other plans.""Dzhokhar ditched the stolen car and sought shelter in a dry-docked boat parked in a trailer in a backyard in Watertown. As he hid he used a pencil to scrawl what prosecutors called a ""manifesto"" in which he said he was jealous of his brother for dying as a martyr and reaching paradise. He also lashed out at the United States for policies he said killed Muslims writing ""I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished. We Muslims are one body you hurt one you hurt us all.""Federal prosecutors also presented evidence gleaned from searches of the brothers' computers including militant literature written by top al Qaeda leaders.

Slager 33 a five-year veteran of the North Charleston force was denied bond at a brief first appearance hearing Tuesday. If convicted he faces 30 years to life in prison.North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey announced the charges at a hastily called news conference in which he said City Patrolman Michael Thomas Slager made ""a bad decision.""""When you're wrong you're wrong "" Summey said. ""When you make a bad decision don't care if you're behind the shield or a citizen on the street you have to live with that decision.""The video which was obtained by The Post and Courier of Charleston from a source who asked to remain anonymous shows the confrontation between the two on Saturday after Scott ran away from a traffic stop. Authorities say Scott of Charleston was shot after the officer already hit him with a stun gun.A video of the shooting released to news media outlets shows the officer firing eight shots at Scott's back as Scott is running away. Scott falls on the eighth shot fired after a brief pause. The video then shows the officer slowly walking toward him and ordering him to put his hands behind his back.When Scott doesn't move Slager pulls his arms back and cuffs his hands. Then he walks briskly back to where he fired the shots picks up an object and returns the 30 feet or so back to Scott before dropping the object by Scott's feet.Attorney David Aylor said after the video surfaced Tuesday that he was no longer representing Slager. Aylor had released a statement Monday saying the officer felt threatened and that the motorist was trying to grab the officer's stun gun.""This is a terrible tragedy that has impacted our community "" Aylor told the Post and Courier.Attorney L. Chris Stewart who came to North Charleston a day after the shooting to represent the family said the video forced authorities to act quickly and decisively and he called the person who made the video a hero.""What happened today doesn't happen all the time "" Stewart told a news conference. What if there was no video?"" Scott's mother stood nearby saying ""Thank you Lord"" and ""Hallelujah."" Stewart said the family plans to file a lawsuit against the police department. Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson said the Federal Bureau of Investigation will also investigate the shooting.Scott's brother Anthony said Tuesday night that because of the video ""we have received the truth"" and ""through the process justice has been served.""According to The Post and Courier Scott was wanted for arrest on a Family Court warrant and had a history of arrests related to contempt of court charges for failing to pay child support. Stewart said Scott had four children was engaged and had been honorably discharged from the U.S. Coast Guard.

Blackwell allegedly pulled a gun from his waistband and opened fire on both officers who were in the car and had no chance to fire back.Moore was struck in the head and Jansen seeing that he was seriously wounded immediately called for transportation to a hospital. Officers canvassed the area searching for the suspect and witnesses told them about a man matching Blackwell's description fleeing through the neighborhood.Officers were able to apprehend Blackwell who has served time in jail and has been arrested in the past in connection with criminal weapon possession and robbery Bratton said.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio was at the hospital where Moore was taken. He praised the officer's service.""He is a brave young man ... he comes from a police family. This is what he wanted to do with his life. He wanted to be a New York City police officer. He wanted to serve and he did so with great distinction "" de Blasio said.The mayor condemned the shooting as ""an unconscionable act of violence not just against one police officer but against the city of New York and against the values we hold dear.""A doctor said it could take as long as two days to determine Moore's prognosis."69,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/04/08/closing-arguments-due-in-first-phase-boston-marathon-bombing-trial/,Dzhokhar Tsarnaev found guilty on all counts in Boston Marathon bombing,"Tsarnaev guilty on all charges of Boston bombingNever autoplay videosDzhokhar Tsarnaev was convicted Wednesday in the Boston Marathon bombing by a federal jury that now must decide whether he should be executed.The verdict was reached Wednesday afternoon nearly two years to the day three people were killed and more than 260 injured in the April 15 2013 bombings.Tsarnaev 21 showed no emotion as he listened to the verdict reached after a day and a half of deliberations. He was found guilty on all 30 counts that included conspiracy and use of a weapon of mass destruction -- offenses punishable by death.His conviction was practically a foregone conclusion given his lawyer's startling admission during opening statements that Tsarnaev carried out the attack with his now-dead older brother Tamerlan.The two shrapnel-packed pressure-cooker bombs that exploded near the finish line turning the traditionally celebratory home stretch of the world-famous race into a scene of carnage and putting the city on edge for days.More on this...Did defense do enough to spare Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's life?In the next phase of the trial the jury will hear evidence on whether Tsarnaev should get the death penalty or spend the rest of his life in prison.""It's not a happy occasion but it's something "" said Karen Brassard who suffered shrapnel wounds on her legs and attended the trial. ""One more step behind us.""She said Tsarnaev appeared ""arrogant"" and uninterested during the trial and she wasn't surprised when she saw no remorse on his face as the verdicts were read. She refused to say whether she believes he deserves the death penalty but she rejected the defense argument that he was simply following his brother's lead.""He was in college. He was a grown man who knew what the consequences would be "" Brassard said.Tsarnaev's lawyers left the courthouse without comment.In a bid to save Tsarnaev from a death sentence defense attorney Judy Clarke has argued that Tsarnaev then 19 fell under the influence of his radicalized brother. Tamerlan 26 died when he was shot by police and run over by his brother during a chaotic getaway attempt days after the bombing.""If not for Tamerlan it would not have happened "" Clarke told the jury during closing arguments.Prosecutors however portrayed the brothers -- ethnic Chechens who moved to the U.S. from Russia more than a decade ago -- as full partners in a plan to punish the U.S. for its wars in Muslim countries. Jihadist writings lectures and videos were found on both their computers though the defense argued that Tamerlan downloaded the material and sent it to his brother.The government called 92 witnesses over 15 days painting a hellish scene of torn-off limbs blood-spattered pavement ghastly screams and the smell of sulfur and burned hair. Survivors gave heartbreaking testimony about losing legs in the blasts or watching people die. The father of an 8-year-old boy described making the agonizing decision to leave his mortally wounded son so he could get help for their 6-year-old daughter whose leg had been blown off.Killed were Lingzi Lu a 23-year-old Chinese graduate student at Boston University; Krystle Campbell a 29-year-old restaurant manager; and Martin Richard the 8-year-old. Massachusetts Institute of Technology police Officer Sean Collier was shot and killed during the brothers' getaway attempt.In a statement Collier's family welcomed the verdict and added: ""The strength and bond that everyone has shown during these last two years proves that if these terrorists thought that they would somehow strike fear in the hearts of people they monumentally failed.""Some of the most damning evidence included video showing Tsarnaev planting a backpack containing one of the bombs near where the 8-year-old was standing and incriminating statements scrawled inside the dry-docked boat where a wounded and bleeding Tsarnaev was captured days after the tragedy.""Stop killing our innocent people and we will stop "" he wrote.Tsarnaev's lawyers barely cross-examined the government's witnesses and called just four people to the stand over less than two days all in an effort to portray the older brother as the guiding force in the plot.Witnesses testified about phone records that showed Dzhokhar was at the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth while his brother was buying bomb components including pressure cookers and BBs. A forensics expert said Tamerlan's computer showed search terms such as ""detonator "" ""transmitter and receiver "" while Dzhokhar was largely spending time on Facebook and other social media sites.Also an FBI investigator said Tamerlan's fingerprints -- but not Dzhokhar's -- were found on pieces of the two bombs.Clarke is one of the nation's foremost death-penalty specialists and has kept other high-profile defendants off death row. She saved the lives of Unabomber Ted Kaczynski and Susan Smith the South Carolina woman who drowned her two children in a lake in 1994.Tsarnaev's lawyers tried repeatedly to get the trial moved out of Boston because of the heavy publicity and the widespread trauma. But opposition to capital punishment is strong in Massachusetts which abolished its state death penalty in 1984 and some polls have suggested a majority of Bostonians do not want to see Tsarnaev sentenced to die.During the penalty phase Tsarnaev's lawyers will present so-called mitigating evidence they hope will save his life. That could include evidence about his family his relationship with his brother and his childhood in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan and later in the volatile Dagestan region of Russia.Prosecutors will present so-called aggravating factors in support of the death penalty including the killing of a child and the targeting of the marathon because of the potential for maximum bloodshed.Dan Collins a former federal prosecutor who handled the case against a suspect in the 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai India said Massachusetts' history of opposition to capital punishment will have no bearing on the jury's decision about Tsarnaev's fate.""When you ask people their opinion of the death penalty there are a number who say it should only be reserved for the horrific cases "" he said. ""Here you have what is one of the most horrific acts of terrorism on U.S. soil in American history so if you are going to reserve the death penalty for the worst of the worse this is it.""Liz Norden the mother of two sons who lost parts of their legs in the bombing said death would be the appropriate punishment: ""I don't understand how anyone could have done what he did.""Fox News' Molly Line and The Associated Press contributed to this report.

And finally came a photo of an unidentified small boy carrying a rifle.It is not known when or where the photographs were taken.They came to light during the testimony of defense witness Mark Spencer a digital forensics expert from Arsenal Consultants.Spencer said the images were recovered from an encrypted file called ""Document"" on Tsarnaev's Samsung laptop after his death.Tamerlan Tsarnaev was shot by police and run over by his brother in the aftermath the deadly bombings at the 2013 Boston Marathon.How did Tsarnaevs prepare for Boston bombing? 01:43PLAY VIDEOThe defense expert delved into Tamerlan's computer files in much the same way federal prosecutors rooted through his younger brother's Sony laptop earlier in this trial.Tamerlan the heavy Jahar the pawnDzhokhar ""Jahar"" Tsarnaev was convicted of 30 counts relating to the bombings and their aftermath; 17 counts involving the murders of three marathon spectators and an MIT police officer carry the death penalty as a possible sentence.Defense attorneys are fighting to convince jurors to spare 21-year-old Jahar Tsarnaev from execution and instead sentence him to life in prison without parole. The defense strategy includes shifting the focus of the trial to Tamerlan's radical beliefs and the power he held over his younger brother. They are trying to make Tamerlan the heavy and Jahar his pawn.One of the witnesses a boxing coach who knew the brothers when they were younger spoke the words that surely were music to the defense attorneys' ears. Asked to describe Jahar John Curran said: ""I remember mentioning to somebody that he was like a puppy following his brother.""The subject of Tamerlan has dominated the testimony. Besides the computer expert and his former boxing coach witnesses have included his music teacher his mother-in-law his wife's best friend a handful of classmates and acquaintances and his landlady's son.They spoke about how he pursued a career as an amateur boxer but was disappointed when his lack of U.S. citizenship stifled his progress. He went from hard-drinking pot smoking drug dealer to clean-living devout stay-at-home dad.While he once was a flashy dresser who left a plume of aftershave behind him and wore boots the color of aluminum foil he began to walk the streets of Cambridge in the flowing robes of devout Muslims.All the while the defense says he obsessively trolled the Internet in search of the messages of violent jihad. His encrypted file included dozens of dead and maimed children apparently from conflicts abroad.The radicalization of Dzhokhar TsarnaevAccidental disclosureIn addition to Tuesday's testimony disclosures about the defense case and behind-the-scenes dramas involving the witnesses were accidentally disclosed in a transcript of defense attorney David Bruck's opening statement. Copies of the transcript were purchased by CNN and several other media outlets.The transcript inadvertently included sidebar conversations between Judge George O'Toole and the prosecution and defense teams. Those conversations usually are held in the judge's chambers or otherwise out of earshot of the jury and the public. At times the court plays soft jazz to prevent eavesdropping.How the Tsarnaevs' plan unraveled 01:15PLAY VIDEOBut the transcript revealed the following:One friend of Tamerlan's is missing and neither the defense nor the prosecution can find him. Another friend refuses to testify and planned to invoke his 5th Amendment right against self-incrimination if he was forced to take the witness stand.Reports of FBI interviews with the two men -- the missing Magomed Dalokov and reluctant Viskian Vakhabov -- were read into the court record on Tuesday. Dalokov went to a gym and boxed with the brothers on the Friday night before the bombings. Vakhabov told the FBI that Tamerlan Tsarnaev spoke often about his belief in violent jihad and believed it was ""the right way to go.""The defense had planned to introduce evidence that Tamerlan Tsarnaev was violent with his wife Katherine Russell but that avenue of questioning was cut off by a prosecutor's objection.The trial record as it stands is as follows:Katherine Russell's best friend since childhood Gina Crawford is on the stand. She is asked about a phone call she received from Katherine's college roommates while she was dating Tamerlan.""The other roommates were upset "" she said. ""They thought Katie was in domestic ...""""Objection!"" Assistant U.S. Attorney William Weinreb thundered and the lawyers quickly moved to sidebar. Strains of jazz wafted from the speakers.Boston Marathon bomber flips the bird at camera 01:55PLAY VIDEODefense attorney Judy Clarke filled in the blanks according to the accidentally leaked transcript:""I know what she'll say. She got a telephone call from one of the parents of Katherine's roommates who reported that their daughter had reported that Tamerlan was physically abusive to Katherine.""Weinreb objected that the testimony was ""hearsay on top of hearsay.""Clarke persisted ""But the government knows as well as we know that this is corroborated by an email that one of the roommates sent to a family member about Tamerlan being abusive to Katherine this incident and the roommates moved out. So that's been -- I mean it's not a hearsay sort of pulled out of the air.""The judge upheld the government's objection and the testimony was not heard.Defense: Life in prison means no martyrdom for TsarnaevA mother-in-law's suspicionsThe transcript also revealed that Judith Russell Tamerlan's mother-in-law had her suspicions about his involvement in the bombing even before the FBI knew his identity. She called the FBI when she learned he was dead.""At some point Ms. Russell thought for a moment that it could have been Tamerlan that bombed the Boston Marathon and the reason she thought that was because he had become intensely radical in his views of Islam and politics and she was aware that the FBI had interviewed him at some point "" Clarke explained at yet another sidebar.""So she had these immediate concerns and then she pushed them out of her head because she thought how horrible could it be that she could have that thought about him her own son-in-law.""Boston bombing: The dead and injured 20 photosEXPAND GALLERYAnd finally the transcript revealed that five people including Tsarnaev's relatives have been brought to the United States from Russia to testify for the defense. The FBI has dedicated 16 agents to guard them from journalists and gawkers which Weinreb said the agency considers ""an enormous expense and distraction.""The government intends to send the Russians back home before the weekend he added. ""I just want the record to reflect that it is still our intention that they are all going back to Russia on Friday whether they have testified or not.""Defense attorney William Fick however complained that it was having trouble gaining access to the Russians given ""the condition under which their presence was permitted and the conditions under which we're able to interact with them.""It appears the Russian relatives will testify one after another on Thursday according to the transcript. The defense estimates each will take the stand for 30 minutes.Prosecution shows what it calls Tsarnaev's defiant message to U.S."70,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/04/10/anne-arundel-county-md-police-officer-shot-critically-wounded/,Maryland police search for gunman who critically wounded police officer,ARNOLD Md  Police in Maryland launched a manhunt Friday for a gunman who shot and critically wounded a veteran police officer near an all-night Annapolis convenience store.The Anne Arundel County officer was on routine patrol when he pulled up to a 7-Eleven on East College Parkway around 2:20 a.m. Friday police said.Inside the store the cop was told that a man standing outside was acting suspiciously.The Fox affiliate in Baltimore said that when the officer went to investigate a struggle ensued and the man took off pursued by the officer.During the pursuit the officer was struck in the upper body by a single gunshot.

Video from the card showed the 29-year-old pilot with several passengers on flights the previous day and one nighttime flight shortly before the fatal trip taking photos of himself with his cell phone according to investigators.""The camera's flash was activated and illuminated the cockpit area "" the report said.The fatal flight on May 31 was not captured on the GoPro footage but investigators said that the pilot who is not identified in the report was at the controls of the plane when it stalled and crashed in a wheat field bounced once and came to rest upright.It's likely that the use of cell phones during that flight ""distracted the pilot "" the report said causing him to develop spatial disorientation and lose control of the plane. The aircraft went into a stall and then spun before crashing investigators said.Investigators found nothing wrong with the aircraft itself that might have contributed to the crash the NTSB said.The 29-year-old pilot had a total of 726 total fight hours and 27 hours of experience flying at night.

The blast killed a 23-year-old graduate student from China. The jurors heard more horror from April 15 2013. At one point prosecutors played a video that showed the scene after a bomb exploded -- blood and injured victims everywhere and the sounds of a child howling. His mother lost her leg.""The defendant brought terrorism into the backyards and main streets "" Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty said. ""The defendant thought that his values were more important than the people around him. He wanted to awake the mujahedeen the holy warriors so he chose Patriots' Day Marathon Monday "" a time for families to gather and watch the marathon.Tsarnaev's defense attorney Judy Clarke tried to persuade jurors that her client's older brother 26-year-old Tamerlan Tsarnaev who died in a shootout with police days after the terror attack was the instigator of the marathon plot. The younger man Clarke said was only following his older brother.""If not for Tamerlan it would not have happened "" Clarke argued.Bomb survivors and victims' family members wiped away tears and comforted one another in court.Tsarnaev fidgeted at the defense table as he has done throughout the trial.Bill Richard father of bomb victim Martin Richard 8 craned his neck to watch Tsarnaev as the prosecutor spoke.Reporter: Jury may think life sentence worse than death 03:36PLAY VIDEODzhokhar Tsarnaev ""chose a day when the eyes of the world would be on Boston "" Chakravarty said. ""He chose a day when there would be civilians on the sidewalks and he targeted those civilians: men women and children.""The lawyer waited a beat.""He wanted to terrorize this country. He wanted to punish America for what it was doing to his people.""The prosecutor showed a picture of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan in the marathon crowd.The day of the bombings Chakravarty said ""they felt they were soldiers. They were the mujahedeen and they were bringing their battle to Boston.""The counts and possible consequencesTsarnaev is accused of 30 counts including setting off weapons of mass destruction at a public event as an act of terrorism. Seventeen of those counts carry a sentence of death or life imprisonment.If Tsarnaev is found guilty of at least one of the 17 capital counts the trial will proceed to a second phase the so-called penalty phase.That part of the trial will include evidence of aggravating and mitigating factors and the jury will be asked to weigh elements that make this crime especially heinous against details from Tsarnaev's background and mental health history that would weigh in his favor.Jury to begin deliberations on Tsarnaev's fate 02:15PLAY VIDEOSince testimony began March 4 federal prosecutors have called 92 witnesses and the defense just four. It seemed a mismatch from the start. ""He was there "" Clarke conceded as the trial opened but the defense strategy always had been to focus on persuading the jury to spare Tsarnaev's life.Jurors were shown a photo of Tsarnaev standing by a tree behind the family of Martin Richard.""These children weren't innocent to him "" the prosecutor said. ""They were American. He knew what that bag was designed to do.""Chakravarty quoted Martin's father who earlier testified ""I guess we were just unlucky that day.""But luck had nothing to do with the Boston bombings the prosecutor said.""This was a cold intentional terrorist act "" he said. The brothers' acts that day were intended he said ""to make a point. To tell America 'We won't be terrorized by you anymore. We will terrorize you.' ""Retelling a terrifying dayThe defense has maintained that Tsarnaev who was 19 and flunking out of college at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth fell under the sway of his older more radicalized brother.""In the past few weeks we have come face to face with tragedy suffering and grief in dimensions none of us could imagine "" Clarke said. ""We've heard words we've heard screams and we've heard cries.

They were ""partners in crime.""Weinreb pointed out that after the bombing Tsarnaev went to the grocery store.""Tamerlan Tsarnaev didn't turn his brother into a murderer. To shred the bodies of women and children with a homemade type of bomb you have to be different from other people "" the prosecutor said. ""If you are capable of such hate such callousness that you can murder and maim 20 people and then drive to Whole Foods and buy some milk can you really blame it on your brother?""The radicalization of Dzhokhar TsarnaevFinal moments of the victimsFrom the start prosecutors presented a compelling case in which the horrors of April 15 to 19 2013 were vividly brought to life once again.They began with the stories of bombing survivors and first responders who described acts of courage and compassion amid madness and chaos.The final moments of the three Boston Marathon spectators who died were recounted by the people who were by their sides.According to testimony Tamerlan Tsarnaev set off a bomb made from a 6-quart pressure cooker explosive powder from fireworks duct tape nails and BBs on Boylston Street near the finish line. That bomb which exploded near Marathon Sports claimed the life of Krystle Campbell a 29-year-old restaurant manager.Twelve seconds later Dzhokhar Tsarnaev allegedly detonated a second similar bomb outside the Forum restaurant slightly more than a block away. That blast killed the boy Martin Richard and Lingzi Lu 23 a graduate student from China.Chakravarty's voice grew soft Monday as he recalled the victims:Martin's 69-pound body ""was shattered broken eviscerated burned. There wasn't a part of this boy's body that wasn't destroyed.""Lu ""received blast injuries all over her body. Her leg was torn open and she bled out.""Campbell died in less than a minute from ""massive blast injuries to her lower extremities. Parts of her body were shredded.""Sean Collier the MIT campus police officer killed three days after the bombings ""never had a chance."" He was shot between the eyes. ""They assassinated him.""The brothers allegedly killed the 26-year-old officer for his service weapon but couldn't pry it loose from a safety holster.Case ends with grisly photos and testimonyCarjacked by the brothersDun Meng told the jury about his frightening 90 minutes with two carjackers one who admitted being involved in the marathon bombing. He identified that person as Tamerlan Tsarnaev.Police fired 210 rounds at the brothers when they tracked a GPS device in Meng's stolen Mercedes and cornered them in Watertown Massachusetts. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev struck Tamerlan who was wounded when he charged police in the car. Tamerlan died of his injuries.""Tamerlan wanted suicide by cop "" the prosecutor said Monday. ""He was ready for heaven. But the defendant had other plans.""Dzhokhar ditched the stolen car and sought shelter in a dry-docked boat parked in a trailer in a backyard in Watertown. As he hid he used a pencil to scrawl what prosecutors called a ""manifesto"" in which he said he was jealous of his brother for dying as a martyr and reaching paradise. He also lashed out at the United States for policies he said killed Muslims writing ""I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished. We Muslims are one body you hurt one you hurt us all.""Federal prosecutors also presented evidence gleaned from searches of the brothers' computers including militant literature written by top al Qaeda leaders. And they traced the purchase of the pressure cookers ammunition and BBs which appeared to have been made by Tamerlan.Boston trial: What defense?"80,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/04/24/baltimore-police-prisoner-transport-under-scrutiny-after-past-death-possible/,Baltimore police prisoner transport under scrutiny after past death  possible policy violation,"Members of the Baltimore Police Department stand guard outside the department's Western District police station during a protest for Freddie Gray Thursday April 23 2015 in Baltimore. Gray died from spinal injuries about a week after he was arrested and transported in a police van. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) (The Associated Press)BALTIMORE  People in Baltimore and other cities accuse police of sometimes giving prisoners an extra-rough ""nickel ride"" a reference to amusement rides that once cost a nickel. Now the safety of people in Baltimore's police vans is under scrutiny because of a past death and a new fatal injury one that came after police failed to put a seat belt on a passenger.One of those Dondi Johnson died of a fractured spine in 2005 two weeks after he was arrested for urinating in a public street and transported by van. Johnson's family won a $7.4 million judgment that was reduced to $200 000 the legal cap for such cases. Family lawyer Kerry D. Staton said Johnson was seated alone in the van with his hands cuffed behind him and no seat belt to restrain him.It is police policy that all arrestees must be buckled in during transport. The policy updated just nine days before Freddie Gray was injured states ""all passengers regardless of age and location shall be restrained by seat belts or other authorized restraining devices.""An attorney representing one of the six officers involved in Gray's arrest said it can sometimes be difficult or even dangerous for officers to belt prisoners if they're agitated.""It is not always possible or safe for officers to enter the rear of those transport vans that are very small and this one was very small.""But Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said Thursday that here are no circumstances under which a prisoner should not be wearing a seatbelt during transport and ""that's part of our investigation.""Much like any other vehicle you seatbelt people in and it's our responsibility to make sure people are safely transported "" Batts said ""especially if their hands are behind their back.""Gray fled on foot and was captured on April 12 after an officer ""made eye contact"" with him outside a public housing complex police said. Videos show Gray screaming on the ground before being dragged his legs limp into a police transport van. Witnesses said he was crying out in pain.Authorities say they do not know how or exactly when Gray suffered the fatal injury.Batts said another man who was in the van during the tail end of Gray's ride told investigators that Gray was ""was still moving around that he was kicking and making noises"" up until the van arrived at the station. Batts said the man also said the driver did not speed make sudden stops of ""drive erratically.""But Batts was careful to say that the investigation includes ""everything the officers did that day.""On Thursday protesters briefly scuffled with police shouting at them and throwing objects. Police said on their Twitter feed that at least two people were taken into custody for disorderly conduct and destruction of property. The protesters also surrounded a police transport van similar to the one Gray was put in after he was arrested. Outside of the Western District station house protesters gathered peacefully while more than 50 officers manned barricades.More protests are planned for the weekend. On Saturday demonstrators are expected to gather at both City Hall and the site of Gray's arrest in Baltimore's Sandtown neighborhood.",http://us.cnn.com/2015/05/01/us/freddie-gray-baltimore-death/index.html,Freddie Gray death ruled homicide; officers charged,"Story highlightsSix police officers charged prosecutor saysMore protests over Freddie Gray's death scheduled for Friday in Baltimore and other citiesPolice reveal additional previously unmentioned van stop arousing protester suspicions(CNN)[Breaking news update at 11:04 a.m.]Six police officers have been charged in the death of Freddie Gray Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby said Friday.

The report's findings have not been made public.In the meantime the mystery of how the 25-year-old died has only grown more complex.Police revealed Thursday a transport van carrying Gray made an additional stop after his arrest April 12. Deputy Police Commissioner Kevin Davis said the stop was recorded by a privately owned video camera arousing suspicion among protesters who wondered why it was not previously mentioned.The video belonged to shop owner Hwang Jung who said police copied the footage. The original was lost when his store was subsequently looted he said.45 CVS workers still getting paid after riots shut down storesThe new stop Davis said came between the first and second stops. Before it surfaced police had spoken of three stops before arriving at the police precinct -- one to put leg irons on Gray a second ""to deal with Mr. Gray "" and a third to pick up an additional prisoner.That second stop remains under investigation.Exactly when and how Gray suffered the injuries isn't known publicly at least. Some have said it appeared to occur during his arrest others have theorized it may have been the result of injuries suffered during his ride to the police station. Police have said only that Gray had not been properly fastened into the van a violation of department policy.Was it in the van?Gray injuries may have occurred in the van according to a report by CNN affiliate WJLA-TV in Washington. The police investigation did not find he died from injuries caused during his arrest the station reported citing ""multiple law enforcement sources briefed on the police findings.""Instead the station reported investigators believe Gray slammed into part of the police van apparently breaking his neck. A head injury matches up to a bolt in the van the station reported without mentioning how the injury may have happened.An official in Maryland's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner wouldn't comment to CNN on the report citing the ongoing investigation.Was it during the arrest?The account of a woman related to one of the six officers involved in Gray's arrest appeared to contradict the WJLA report.She said that the officer believes Gray was injured during his arrest although he does not know so for sure. She spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity and said the officer didn't ask her to give the interview.Officer's family member: There are some bad apples 05:56PLAY VIDEOShe is worried all six officers who encountered Gray during his arrest will be incriminated and punished when only two or three might be responsible.""Six officers did not injure this man "" she said.

""So what that says to me is that if it's going to take a closed-circuit private camera to show the stop that they were not getting that information from the police officers during the investigation.""But Baltimore police Commissioner Anthony Batts told CNN's Chris Cuomo that people are jumping to conclusions and no one is trying to cover anything up.""I think it's unfortunate that these little things are coming out.

The president of a black lawyers' group predicted thousands of people would turn out for the demonstration when good weather is forecast and the Baltimore Orioles host the Boston Red Sox.""Things will change on Saturday and the struggle will be amplified "" said Malik Shabazz of Black Lawyers for Justice. ""It cannot be business as usual with that man's spine broken with his back broken with no justice on the scene.""Shabazz has demanded the arrest of six officers involved in the arrest of Gray who died Sunday a week after suffering a spinal injury while in police custody.The officers are suspended with pay and under criminal investigation by their own department. The U.S. Justice Department is reviewing the case for any civil rights violations and Gray's family is conducting their own probe.Late Friday Deputy Commissioner Kevin Davis said Gray 25 should have received medical attention at the spot where he was arrested before he was put inside a police transport van handcuffed and without a seat belt a violation of the Police Department's policy.Gray who is black was arrested April 12 after he made eye contact with officers and ran away police said. Officers held him down handcuffed him and loaded him into the van. While inside he became irate and leg cuffs were put on him police have said.Gray asked for medical help several times beginning before he was placed in the van. After a 30-minute ride that included three stops paramedics were called.Authorities have not explained how or when Gray's spine was injured.Commissioner Anthony Batts said it was possible Gray was hurt before the van ride or during a ""rough ride"" where officers hit the brakes and take sharp turns to injure suspects in the back of vans.""We know he was not buckled in the transportation wagon as he should have been. There's no excuse for that period "" Batts said. ""We know our police employees failed to give him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times.""Earlier Friday Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said she has many questions.""I still want to know why the policies and procedures for transport were not followed "" she said. ""I still want to know why none of the officers called for immediate medical assistance despite Mr. Gray's apparent pleas.""The one thing we all know is because of this incident a mother has to bury their child and she doesn't even know exactly how or why this tragedy occurs only that this occurs while her child was in police custody "" the mayor said. ""This is absolutely not acceptable and I want answers.""Rawlings-Blake expects the results of the Police Department's investigation to be turned over to prosecutors in a week and they will decide whether any criminal charges will be filed or whether to put the case before a grand jury. There is no timetable for when that will happen.The leader of a group of local ministers called on Batts to resign immediately.""It seems that no one in the Police Department can explain what happened "" said the Rev. Alvin Gwynn Sr. president of the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance of Baltimore.He said the Police Department is ""in disarray"" and Batts has shown a ""lack of viable leadership capabilities.""The mayor appeared to back the police commissioner at her own news conference and Batts defended his record saying he was brought on in 2012 to reform the department. Since then he said he has fired 50 employees and reduced the number of officer-involved shootings and excessive force complaints.The Rev. Frank Reid of Bethel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Baltimore who met with Rawlings-Blake on Friday said he wants to believe the Police Department's investigation will be transparent.""I want to take them at their word but the purpose of being here today is to not only to let the city know but the Police Department know that we're going to hold them accountable "" Reid said.

This stage will determine whether he is executed or spends the rest of his life behind bars.""There is no evening the scales "" Bruck said in his opening statement. ""There is no point in trying to hurt him as he hurt because it can't be done.""Tsarnaev 21 already has been convicted of 30 federal charges in the twin bombings that killed three spectators and injured more than 260 others near the marathon's finish line on April 15 2013. He was also convicted of killing Massachusetts Institute of Technology police Officer Sean Collier days after the bombings. Seventeen of those charges carry the possibility of the death penalty.Prosecutors are pushing for his execution. Their case in this second phase of the trial lasted just three days. Tsarnaev's defense is expected to take up to two weeks.His lawyers' primary task will be to humanize Tsarnaev and undermine prosecutors' depiction of him as a ruthless and heartless terrorist who placed a bomb just feet from a group of children and targeted the marathon for maximum bloodshed.In the trial's first phase the defense tried to show that at the time of the attacks Tsarnaev was a 19-year-old college student flunking out of school and heavily influenced by his radicalized older brother Tamerlan 26.The defense likely is to continue emphasizing that theme but may also focus on Tsarnaev's seeming aimlessness to show that he did not appear to be motivated by political concerns and that his late brother was the driving force behind the attack aimed at punishing the U.S. for its wars in Muslim countries.The witness list has not been made public but legal experts expect the defense to call family members and friends who will describe Tsarnaev as a well-behaved child who appeared to adjust well to his life in the U.S. after moving here with his parents and siblings from Russia about a decade before the bombings.",http://us.cnn.com/2015/03/30/us/tsarnaev-boston-marathon-bombing-prosecution-ending/index.html,U.S. ending Boston Marathon bomb case with grisly photos of victims,"Boston (CNN)Federal prosecutors are expected to wrap up their case against Dzhokhar Tsarnaev on Monday with disturbing unforgettable images showing the damage homemade bombs made from pressure cookers fireworks and BBs do to human beings.Several jurors cried and others appeared upset as they were shown graphic photos of Boston Marathon bombing victim Krystle Campbell a 29-year-old restaurant manager during the closing minutes of Thursday's court session.The grim testimony resumed Monday morning when the government began calling its closing witnesses: the medical examiners who performed autopsies on two other spectators at the 2013 Boston Marathon 23-year-old grad student Lingzi Lu and 8-year-old Martin Richard.Campbell was standing in front of Marathon Sports on Boylston Street near the finish line and was killed by a bomb left on the sidewalk by Tsarnaev's older brother Tamerlan.Photos and security surveillance videos introduced during the trial show Dzhokhar Tsarnaev sliding a backpack containing a pressure cooker bomb off his shoulder near the Forum restaurant a block away. That explosion 12 seconds after the first killed Lu and Richard.Photos: Deadly attack at Boston Marathon 55 photosEXPAND GALLERYA body riddled with injuriesJennifer Hammers who performed the autopsy on Campbell said Thursday her death was a homicide caused by blast injuries to the legs and torso. She said it probably took less than a minute for Campbell to bleed to death on the sidewalk.Hammers went on to explain how the homemade bombs maim and kill and to provide the gruesome details of the damage done to Campbell's body. The initial injuries came as a result of a shock wave from the blast: Campbell's tongue was bruised from being forced against her teeth the femur of her left leg snapped and the bones in her left foot were crushed.""The seams of her blue jeans were pressed into her body with such force they caused bruising "" Hammers said.Other injuries were caused by bomb materials and debris sent flying through the air. Campbell's hair was singed the skin on the back of her neck was abraded and she had a large third-degree burn on her back. The top of her right arm was burned.She had ""big gaping holes in her legs "" Hammers said. The gashes were as large as 10 inches.A pellet the size of a BB was embedded in her ear and other BBs and metal fragments were found in wounds that penetrated her muscles. BBs also riddled her clothes.""Miss Campbell passed away because she lost a significant amount of blood in a short period of time "" Hammers said.Remembering Krystle Campbell 02:09PLAY VIDEORemembering 8-year-old bombing victim 03:20PLAY VIDEOMany remember Boston victim Lingzi Lu 02:42PLAY VIDEOBeyond the clinical details of what happened to Campbell's body jurors also have heard from a friend who described what must have been the last minute of Campbell's life.Karen Rand McWatters whose leg was so mangled it had to be amputated dragged herself to Campbell's side:""I got as close as I could to her. There was so much chaos and so much screaming. For some reason I got close to her head and we put our faces together. I never really looked at Krystle's injuries. She very slowly said her legs hurt and we held hands. Very shortly after her hand went limp and we never spoke again.""Prosecutors say the disturbing evidence is needed to prove several of the counts against Tsarnaev: using a weapon of mass destruction bombing a public place and malicious destruction of property resulting in death.Monday will be the 15th day of testimony in the trial which opened March 4 after lengthy jury selection.Two phases of the trialJurors first will be asked to determine perhaps by as early as the end of this week whether Tsarnaev is guilty of 30 counts. Because 17 of those counts carry the death penalty as a possible punishment a second phase of the trial will follow if the jury convicts him.In the penalty phase jurors will be asked to weigh aggravating factors such as the heinousness of the crime against mitigating factors such as Tsarnaev's family history and his youth. He was 19 at the time of the bombings.The defense which takes over this week has argued that Tsarnaev known to friends as Jahar fell under the sway of his more extremist older brother after their parents moved back to Russia. Jahar Tsarnaev was flunking out of the University of Massachusetts and had lost his financial aid at the time of the bombings.Prosecutors William Weinreb Aloke Chakravarty Nadine Pellegrini and Steve Mellin presented more than 90 witnesses who told the story of Tsarnaev's alleged scheme with his brother Tamerlan to build and detonate pressure cooker bombs as an act of jihad. The Russian-born brothers Muslims of Chechen descent allegedly sought to kill Americans at an iconic public event to retaliate against U.S. policies they believed harmed and oppressed Muslims abroad.Prosecutors delved into Tsarnaev's text messages and Twitter posts and showed jurors militant material found in his laptop phone and iPod. They included writings available online from top leaders of al Qaeda.They used data mined from a GPS device and store receipts to trace the purchase of the pressure cookers BBs and ammunition. Jurors saw photos of pressure cooker parts fuses Christmas lights and other bombmaking materials found in the Tsarnaev family's Cambridge apartment where Tamerlan lived with his wife and child.And they showed security surveillance videos of the brothers in the crowd near the finish line: In one Jahar Tsarnaev can be seen blending in with the crowd behind the Richard family for four minutes. He appears to slide a backpack off his shoulder near a tree and walk off glancing over his shoulder. He broke into a run as the bomb went off.Boston Marathon bombing evidence 27 photosEXPAND GALLERYAfter the surveillance photos were released to the public three days after the bombing the brothers allegedly embarked on a desperate -- and deadly -- attempt to escape.Jurors heard from carjacking victim Dun Meng and saw the brothers on convenience store surveillance video shortly before Meng's escape. He can be seen jumping out of his leased Mercedes SUV at a gas pump and running across the screen as Jahar Tsarnaev casually strolls through the store picking up an armload of snacks.Prosecutors also used ballistic evidence to link the brothers to the execution-style shooting of a campus cop at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a gun battle with police in Watertown.Tamerlan Tsarnaev 26 died as a result of that gun battle. The defendant allegedly attempting to run down police instead ran over his brother in the stolen Mercedes.Jurors also viewed a boat in which Tsarnaev sought refuge during the ensuing manhunt which put Boston under a ""shelter in place"" lockdown.He used a pencil to scrawl what prosecutors called his ""manifesto"" on the sides of the boat. It was pocked with bullet holes and streaked with blood.He wrote he was jealous that his brother had achieved paradise by dying like a holy warrior in the gun battle with police. He asked God to make him a martyr too.His justification for his actions echoed themes of the militant material on his laptop:""The U.S. Government is killing our innocent civilians but most of you already know that "" he wrote. ""Know you are fighting men who look into the barrel of your gun and see heaven now how can you compete with that. We are promised victory and we will surely get it.""He wrote that he couldn't stand to see the U.S. government ""go unpunished"" for killing Muslims. ""We Muslims are one body you hurt one you hurt us all.""He ended with: ""Now I don't like killing innocent people it is forbidden in Islam but due to said"" -- the word was lost to a bullet hole -- ""it is allowed.""Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty although his lawyers do not dispute that he participated in the bombings. Lead defense attorney Judy Clarke asked jurors in her opening statement to keep their minds open to an alternative explanation.The challenge for the defense will be to present a case that can somehow soften the harsh unforgettable images jurors saw of ordinary people meeting a horrific end."83,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/04/30/2-ferguson-stores-burglarized-during-night-protests-in-st-louis-suburb/,2 Ferguson stores burglarized during night of protests in St. Louis suburb,FERGUSON Mo.

Mosby said the police had no basis for arresting Gray who police said avoided eye contact and was carrying a switchblade. One police officer identified as Caesar Goodson 45 was charged with second-degree murder while others were charged with crimes including manslaughter and assault.""No one is above the law "" declared Mosby who said she comes from three generations of law enforcement and has been on the job for four months. Her husband is Baltimore City Councilman Nick Mosby who has spoken out about the riots and anger in the city's African-American community.Gray suffered a broken neck apparently while riding in the back of the Baltimore police van. Mosby said Friday the medical examiner had ruled the death a homicide. Police sources have said his injuries may have been caused by his head hitting a bolt inside the vehicle according to local reports citing sources familiar with a police report now in the hands of state prosecutors.The charges leveled against the police include:- Goodson was charged with second-degree depraved-heart murder involuntary manslaughter second-degree negligent assault as well as other charges including failure to render aid and misconduct in office.More on this...Has social media exasperated the problems in Baltimore?- Police Officer William Porter was charged with involuntary manslaughter second-degree assault and misconduct in office.- Police Lt. Brian Rice was charged with involuntary manslaughter and second-degree assault.- Police Officer Alicia White was charged with involuntary manslaughter second degree assault and misconduct in office.- Police officers Edward Nero and Garrett Miller were charged with multiple counts of assault false imprisonment and misconduct in office.The Baltimore police officers union issued a statement before Mosby's announcement saying the six officers are not responsible for Gray's death.""As tragic as this situation is none of the officers involved are responsible for the death of Mr. Gray "" Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3 President Gene Ryan said in a statement. ""To the contrary at all times each of the officers diligently balanced their obligations to protect Mr. Gray and discharge their duties to protect the public.""Gray died a week later on April 19. Until Friday's news conference few details about the investigation had been publicly released and most of what was known came from local reports citing unnamed sources. An explosive report Wednesday night in the Washington Post cited a fellow passenger's account in a police affidavit that said Gray was thrashing around in an effort to injure himself although that witness went on the city's CBS affiliate to say his words were taken out of context and that he now fears for his life after his statement was used to bolster the police version of events.When I was in the back of that van it did not stop or nothing "" Danta Allen who had been arrested for allegedly stealing a cigarette told WJZ. ""All it did was go straight to the station but I heard a little banging like he was banging his head Allen said. I didnt even know he was in the van until we got to the station.Gray's lawyer has said his spine was nearly severed but results of an autopsy like the police report remained under wraps. That has fueled frustration and suspicion in the community where peaceful protests devolved into rioting and looting culminating in a night of chaos on Monday.On Thursday Police Commissioner Anthony Batts disclosed that the police van made a previously undisclosed stop one of three stops made while transporting Gray to a hospital. The mystery stop was captured by a privately-owned security camera and could be crucial to the police investigation into Gray's death.Although Gray was reportedly shackled to the bed of the van by leg irons police sources told ABC affiliate WJLA that he was standing without a seat belt on. Just over a week prior to Gray's arrest - for running from police who tried to stop him the Baltimore Police Department issued a new policy making it obligatory to buckle in all inmates being transported in police vans.Batts said his departments report was delivered a day ahead of time to the States Attorney Marilyn Mosby and the commissioner said any questions about it should go to her.Mosby decline to speak publicly Thursday as she issued a statement asking for ""for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system.""Last week Batts said the additional passenger who was picked up along the way had told investigators the driver did not speed make sudden stops or ""drive erratically"" during the trip and that Gray was ""was still moving around that he was kicking and making noises"" up until the van arrived at the police station.The Gray family's lawyers sought to dispel the idea that the police report would be made public at this point.""This family wants justice and they want justice that comes at the right time and not too soon "" attorney Hassan Murphy said Wednesday.Meanwhile protesters over Grays death continue to spread across the nation. Aside from gatherings in Baltimore demonstrations spread into Philadelphia and New York Thursday.Philly.com reports that Philadelphia police made three or four arrests after hundreds of protesters marched through the city to show support for Gray.More demonstrations are planned through the weekend.The Associated Press contributed to this report",http://us.cnn.com/2015/05/04/us/freddie-gray-baltimore-protests/index.html,National Guard plans exit from Baltimore,"Story highlightsBaltimore police say they made 486 arrests at rallies and protests since April 23113 officers have been injured during the last week police saidNational Guard prepares exit as governor announces 200 businesses lost in riots(CNN)Things could be returning to normal in Baltimore: The city has lifted its curfew the National Guard is preparing its exit and a mall that had been a flashpoint in the riots has been reopened.The ""goal "" said Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake ""has always been to not have the curfew in place a single day longer than was necessary.""The mayor spoke following a tour of Mondawmin Mall which reopened Sunday after recovering from rioting that police said was spawned by social media rumors of a ""purge"" following Freddie Gray's death.Because of the improving conditions in the city she said the National Guard will be wrapping up its operations but don't expect the troops to leave immediately.""It's not like you flip a switch "" she said.

""They are truly saddened by his death "" Davey said. ""These officers did nothing wrong.""These are the actions that Mosby said resulted in the charges against the six based on the statement of probable cause:Officer Garrett E. MillerMiller 26 who joined the force in 2012 was one of three officers on bike patrol on the morning of April 12 in Baltimore. One of the other officers made eye contact with Gray who began running.Gray eventually surrendered and was handcuffed. He was ""placed in a prone position with his arms handcuffed behind his back. It was at this time that Mr. Gray indicated that he could not breathe and requested an inhaler to no avail "" Mosby said.Officer Garrett E. MillerMiller and another officer placed Gray in a seated position. They found a knife in his pants pocket. The blade of the knife was folded into the handle. It was not a switchblade and legal to carry under Maryland law.""Mr. Gray was placed back down on his stomach at which time Mr. Gray began to flail his legs and scream as Officer Miller placed Mr. Gray in a restraining technique known as a leg lace "" the prosecutor said.The three officers failed to establish probable cause for Gray's arrest. No crime had been committed. The arrest was illegal Mosby said.When the police van arrived Miller and the two other officers loaded Gray into the wagon. At no point was Gray secured by a seat belt as is required. A while later at Baker Street Miller and the officers removed Gray from the wagon placed handcuffs on his wrists and leg shackles on his ankles. They completed paperwork before loading Gray back into the wagon. He was placed on his stomach headfirst on the floor.Miller is charged with two counts of second-degree assault two counts of misconduct in office and one count of false imprisonment.Lt. Brian W. RiceRice 41 an officer since 1997 was one of the officers on bike patrol during the initial encounter with Gray. He made eye contact with Gray who then ran. Rice and others failed to establish probable cause for Gray's illegal arrest. Later Rice and two other officers handcuffed Gray and put shackles on his ankles. The officers placed Gray back on the floor of the wagon face down.Lt. Brian W. RiceRice is charged with one count of involuntary manslaughter two counts of second-degree assault two counts of misconduct in office and one count of false imprisonment.Separately records from the Carroll County Maryland Sheriff's Department show that Rice was taken to a hospital in 2012 because of concerns about his mental health.The concerns were raised by another officer who is also the mother of Rice's child according to the records. At the time deputies confiscated Rice's guns and alerted his superiors in Baltimore.The records show that Rice said he ""could not continue to go on like this"" and threatened to do something in his laundry room if the mother of his child ""did not come over to his residence."" His specific threat was redacted from the documents. It's unclear how long Rice was at the hospital.Rice could not be reached for comment.Officer Edward M. NeroOfficer Edward M. NeroNero 29 on the job since 2012 was the third officer on bike patrol when Gray was arrested. Mosby said Nero held Gray down until the wagon arrived. Along with Rice and Miller Nero failed to establish probable cause for what Mosby called an illegal arrest. Nero also assisted Rice and Miller later in cuffing and shackling Gray.He is charged with two counts of second-degree assault two counts of misconduct in office and one count of false imprisonment.Officer Caesar R. Goodson Jr.Goodson 45 who joined the police department in 1999 drove the transport wagon. He had been directed to deliver Gray to the central booking facility.At one point Goodson parked the van to check on his prisoner.Officer Caesar R. Goodson Jr.""Despite stopping for the purpose of checking on Mr. Gray's condition at no point did he seek nor did he render any medical assistance for Mr. Gray "" Mosby said.Goodson returned to the driver's seat and headed toward central booking with Gray still unsecured. After several blocks the officer called dispatch to say he needed to check on his prisoner. He requested additional units.Another officer arrived and with Goodson went to the back of the wagon. Gray requested help and said he could not breathe. One officer asked Gray if he needed a medic. Twice Gray said he needed medical assistance. The officer helped lift Gray from the floor to a bench in the van.Again the officers failed to restrain Gray or request medical assistance. Goodson then responded to a separate call for assistance in an arrest.""Despite Mr. Gray's obvious and recognized need for medical assistance Officer Goodson in a grossly negligent manner chose to respond ... with Gray still unsecured by a seat belt in the wagon without rendering or summoning medical assistance "" Mosby said.At the next stop Goodson was met by Miller and three other officers. He walked to the back of the wagon to check on Gray. Goodson and the other officers saw that Gray was unresponsive.Still Goodson picked up a new prisoner and drove to a police station to drop him off. He failed to restrain Gray for at least the fifth time Mosby said. Gray was no longer breathing.Goodson is charged with one count of second-degree depraved-heart murder involuntary manslaughter second-degree assault manslaughter by vehicle (gross negligence) manslaughter by vehicle (criminal negligence) and misconduct in office.CNN legal analyst Sonny Hostin said the depraved-heart murder charge appeared to indicate the prosecutor believes Goodson was ""one of the worst actors"" in Gray's death.""Depraved heart means he intentionally willfully and deliberately acted with depraved indifference to human life "" she said.Sgt. Alicia D. WhiteWhite 30 an officer since 2010 was present during one of the stops to check on Gray's condition. White and two other officers saw that Gray was unresponsive on the floor of the wagon.White who was responsible for investigating two citizen complaints related to Gray's arrest spoke to the back of the prisoner's head.Sgt. Alicia D. WhiteWhen Gray did not respond White allegedly did nothing. She had been advised that Gray needed a medic but made no effort to assess his condition.""Despite Mr. Gray's seriously deteriorating medical condition no medical assistance was rendered or summoned for Mr. Gray at that time by any officer "" Mosby said.Later White and two other officers attempted to remove Gray from the wagon. He was no longer breathing. A medic later determined Gray was in ""cardiac arrest and ... critically and severely injured.""Gray was rushed to the University of Maryland's Shock Trauma Center where he underwent surgery. On April 19 he was pronounced dead from his injuries.""The manner of death deemed a homicide by the Maryland State Medical Examiner is believed to be the result of a fatal injury that occurred while Mr. Gray was unrestrained by a seat belt in the custody of the Baltimore Police Department wagon "" Mosby said.White is charged with one count of involuntary manslaughter second-degree assault and misconduct in office.Officer William G. PorterOfficer William G. PorterPorter 25 who joined the force in 2012 responded when Goodson asked for additional units to check on Gray. The prisoner told Porter he could not breathe. Porter asked Gray if he needed a medic. Gray said ""yes"" twice. The officer helped lift Gray to a bench but did not assess his condition or call for medical assistance. Porter also was present later when Goodson picked up another prisoner and White and others discovered that Gray was unresponsive.Porter is charged with one count of involuntary manslaughter second-degree assault and misconduct in office."86,http://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/05/03/latest-baltimore-lifts-curfew-as-tensions-ease-following-rioting-and-looting/,The Latest: Baltimore lifts curfew as tensions ease following rioting and looting,"11 a.m.Baltimore's mayor has lifted a citywide curfew six days after the death of Freddie Gray sparked riots in the city.The order for residents to stay home after 10 p.m. had been in place since Tuesday and officials had planned to keep it in place through Sunday.

The report's findings have not been made public.In the meantime the mystery of how the 25-year-old died has only grown more complex.Police revealed Thursday a transport van carrying Gray made an additional stop after his arrest April 12. Deputy Police Commissioner Kevin Davis said the stop was recorded by a privately owned video camera arousing suspicion among protesters who wondered why it was not previously mentioned.The video belonged to shop owner Hwang Jung who said police copied the footage. The original was lost when his store was subsequently looted he said.45 CVS workers still getting paid after riots shut down storesThe new stop Davis said came between the first and second stops. Before it surfaced police had spoken of three stops before arriving at the police precinct -- one to put leg irons on Gray a second ""to deal with Mr. Gray "" and a third to pick up an additional prisoner.That second stop remains under investigation.Exactly when and how Gray suffered the injuries isn't known publicly at least. Some have said it appeared to occur during his arrest others have theorized it may have been the result of injuries suffered during his ride to the police station. Police have said only that Gray had not been properly fastened into the van a violation of department policy.Was it in the van?Gray injuries may have occurred in the van according to a report by CNN affiliate WJLA-TV in Washington. The police investigation did not find he died from injuries caused during his arrest the station reported citing ""multiple law enforcement sources briefed on the police findings.""Instead the station reported investigators believe Gray slammed into part of the police van apparently breaking his neck. A head injury matches up to a bolt in the van the station reported without mentioning how the injury may have happened.An official in Maryland's Office of the Chief Medical Examiner wouldn't comment to CNN on the report citing the ongoing investigation.Was it during the arrest?The account of a woman related to one of the six officers involved in Gray's arrest appeared to contradict the WJLA report.She said that the officer believes Gray was injured during his arrest although he does not know so for sure. She spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity and said the officer didn't ask her to give the interview.Officer's family member: There are some bad apples 05:56PLAY VIDEOShe is worried all six officers who encountered Gray during his arrest will be incriminated and punished when only two or three might be responsible.""Six officers did not injure this man "" she said.

""So what that says to me is that if it's going to take a closed-circuit private camera to show the stop that they were not getting that information from the police officers during the investigation.""But Baltimore police Commissioner Anthony Batts told CNN's Chris Cuomo that people are jumping to conclusions and no one is trying to cover anything up.""I think it's unfortunate that these little things are coming out.

A twister destroyed homes in Grady County and it appeared another tornado touched down in the area later Wednesday when a second storm came through.""We do strongly think there was a tornado on the south side of Oklahoma City "" meteorologist Michael Scotten said after the second storm that hit around 8:40 p.m.The stormed flipped vehicles over vehicles on Interstate 35 and left power lines strewn across the roadway Scrotten said.Lara OLeary a spokeswoman for Emergency Medical Services Authority said late Wednesday that the company transported 12 patients from a trailer park in south Oklahoma City to local hospitals. She did not give further details about the extent of the patients injuries.Grady County Emergency Management Director Dale Thompson said about 10 homes were destroyed in Amber and 25 were destroyed in Bridge Creek. As the storm moved to the east forecasters declared a tornado emergency for Moore where seven children were among 24 people killed in a tornado disaster two years ago. When the first storm hit Wednesday school districts held their pupils in safe places.At Will Rogers World Airport in Oklahoma City people were twice evacuated into a tunnel outside the security zone. Flights were canceled for the rest of Wednesday evening shortly after 10 p.m. local time.The same tornado in Grady County prompted fears that exotic animals had escaped a zoo in Tuttle. However all animals were soon accounted for Alisa Voegeli a dispatcher at the sheriffs office said.After tornadoes passed through flash flooding became a major concern.The National Weather Service received reports of 5 to 8 inches of rain in the area Mitchell said. A measurement of 7.1 inches at the Oklahoma City airport set a daily rainfall record he said. It topped the previous record of 2.61 inches. Residents were warned of ""deadly and dangerous"" conditions and told to stay home.Oklahoma City spokeswoman Kristy Yager told The Associated Press the rainfall prompted the city to issue a flash flood emergency for the first time in history.The Storm Prediction Center had warned that bad weather would come to Tornado Alley and more storms were possible later in the week with flooding a major concern. ""People just really need to stay weather aware have a plan and understand that severe storms are possible across portions of the southern Plains almost daily through Saturday "" National Weather Service meteorologist Jonathan Kurtz said.O'Leary said the ambulance service responded to water rescues ""all over"" the Oklahoma City metro area. Two ambulance crews required also assistance after getting stuck in high water she said.  A flash flood warning was in effect for parts of six counties in central Oklahoma until 9 a.m. The same warning was also in effect for two counties in north-central Texas. That area also saw reports of tornadoes late Wednesday but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries according to Mitchell. In Nebraska 10 to 15 homes were damaged near Grand Island and between Hardy and Ruskin near the Kansas line. At least nine tornadoes were reported in Kansas the strongest of them in the sparsely populated north-central part of the state. That included a large tornado near the tiny town of Republic just south of the Nebraska state line where some homes were damaged.

Eric Watson said in a news release.The man was either leaving or standing at the back door of the house and was armed Watson said. One of the two deputies shot him after he refused to give up the weapon.After he was shot and had been placed in the ambulance the man told police that he had exchanged gunfire with the two men who fled on bicycles. By Thursday afternoon police had arrested one of them identified as Thomas Zachary Brown 22. Brown was charged with first-degree burglary and attempted murder in connection with the home invasion. Watson said Brown had not been injured.Online court records did not indicate whether Brown had an attorney and an operator at the sheriff's office said that information was not available.The homeowner was taken to the hospital and was undergoing surgery Watson said. His condition was not known immediately.Watson said the names of the deputy and the shooting victim would be released Friday as would copies of a dashboard camera video. He said the deputies were not equipped with body cameras.The State Law Enforcement Division is investigating the shooting and the sheriffs office will investigate the home invasion Watson said.Police released two 911 tapes of the encounter Thursday. On one an exasperated male caller tells police ""Someone was trying to break into my house. Please come. ... It's an emergency and they have guns. Please come!""The caller becoming increasingly agitated with every question from the operator says the suspects are banging on his windows and that he is hiding in a laundry room. When asked the caller tells the operator to send deputies to both the front and the back door of the home.About nine minutes into the call the man shouts something unintelligible away from the phone as the 911 operator tries to get him back on the call.In a second 911 call a woman asks sheriff's deputies to come to an address that appears to be near the house where the home invasion took place. The caller says she saw two people on bicycles riding through her property and that something happened behind her house.On police radio calls released Thursday there is confusion about the identity of the man who was shot.""It's unknown if he's part of the shooters or the victim "" an officer can be heard saying after an ambulance is called to treat a man with a gunshot wound to the neck.Later an officer asks a dispatcher to summon the State Law Enforcement Division which investigates officer-involved shootings.Hollywood is a small rural community of mobile homes and brick ranch homes about 15 miles west of Charleston.

California officials are expected to consider parole Thursday for a follower of cult leader Charles Manson who has spent 45 years in prison and been denied supervised release 17 times.Robert Beausoleil 67 originally was sentenced to death for the 1969 slaying of musician Gary Hinman but it was commuted to life in prison when the California Supreme Court ruled the death penalty unconstitutional in 1972.If parole officials recommend his release the decision will be reviewed by the entire parole board. Gov. Jerry Brown could also block his parole.In August Brown blocked the release of Bruce Davis 72 who was convicted in the slayings of Hinman and stuntman Donald ""Shorty"" Shea. The parole board had found that Davis was suitable for parole based on his age and good conduct in prison.Beausoleil was an aspiring musician and actor before he joined the Manson family.He was in jail when other Manson followers killed actress Sharon Tate and four others then murdered grocer Leno LaBianca and his wife Rosemary.He was transferred in 1994 to the Oregon State Penitentiary in Salem at his request after he married a woman from Oregon while in prison and fathered four children. California parole officials planned to conduct his hearing by telephone.His release faces opposition from Hinman's cousin Kay Martley who lives in the Denver area and Sharon Tate's sister Debra Tate who lives in the Los Angeles area and is the last surviving member of her immediate family.Both planned to testify by telephone. Tate said in a telephone interview that Beausoleil should serve out the rest of his life sentence in California instead of Oregon.""She has since passed away and he needs to come home now "" Tate said referring to his wife.Beausoleil has worked since 2009 in a furniture factory operated by Oregon Corrections Enterprises according to California corrections officials. He develops and produces orientation safety training and promotional videos and materials for the prison industry program.He has had no disciplinary violations since 2008 and has participated in conflict resolution seminars corrections officials said. He also has attended Narcotics Anonymous meetings and completed a literature class and a sociology class through the University of Oregon.",http://us.cnn.com/2015/02/17/asia/australians-indonesia-death-row/index.html,Australians set to face Indonesian firing squad despite pleas for mercy,"Story highlightsTwo Australians on death row could be executed as soon as this weekOne of their mothers questions why Indonesia calls for mercy for its citizens abroad on death row while sentencing foreigners at homeAustralian police role in the Bali 9 case has been criticizedSydney Australia (CNN)Indonesian authorities remain on course to execute two Australians for drug trafficking despite pleas for leniency made by the government in Canberra and six former prime ministers.Australia's second longest serving premier John Howard said: ""Mercy being shown in such circumstances would not weaken the deterrent effect of Indonesia's strong anti-drug laws "" while Kevin Rudd who served as premier on two occasions said: ""As a deep long-standing friend of Indonesia I would respectfully request an act of clemency."" Julia Gillard Bob Hawke Malcolm Fraser and Paul Keating all followed suit in a united plea to Indonesia's president.Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan members of the so-called ""Bali Nine "" were sentenced to death in 2006 and after several failed legal appeals and two denials of clemency their execution by firing squad may now be close.Bali's Kerobokan prison was given permission this week to move Sukumaran and Chan to a maximum security facility on the island of Nusa Kambangan to have their sentence carried out. But the transfer has now been delayed due to ""technical reasons."" The two men were among five inmates scheduled to be transferred Tony Spontana a spokesman for the Indonesian attorney general's office told CNN.Spontana said requests from Australian officials for the families to spend more time with the prisoners had been granted. He also said one of the prisoners a Brazilian needs medical attention. Spontana added that there was an issue with the holding cell at the prison where the executions would take place.The inmates will be transferred when those issues are resolved he said.Perhaps fearing a boycott national carrier Garuda Airlines has said it would not be involved in their transportation.Most observers believe the executions will proceed despite a last minute appeal to Indonesia's Administrative Court and a new claim that the 2006 trial judges offered a lighter sentence in exchange for a bribe.Indonesia President: 'No compromise' for drug executions 01:26PLAY VIDEOMother: 'Please help'And this hasn't gone down well in Australia.Speaking on Monday Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott asked Indonesia to reconsider their position on Sukumaran and Chan considered the ringleaders of the Bali Nine -- a group of nine Australians who failed in a bid to smuggle more than eight kilograms of heroin back to their country in 2005.""Well what we understand is that there are still legal options available to these two Australians and their legal teams and we certainly appreciate that the Indonesian government doesn't normally go ahead with executions of this type while there are legal options still available and that's what we're saying to the Indonesian government "" he said.At the weekend Abbott struck a more combative tone when he told The Bolt Report on the TEN television network ""we will be finding ways to make our displeasure felt.""He did not detail what the government intended to do.""What we are asking of Indonesia is what Indonesia asks of other countries when its citizens are on death row and if it's right for Indonesia to ask and expect some kind of clemency it's surely right for us to ask and expect some kind of clemency "" he said.It's also a point that the mothers of the two men Raji Sukumaran and Helen Chan struggle to comprehend.""They are helping the Indonesian citizens overseas who are on death row and what is the difference between my son and these people overseas?""

""And not at the last stage when the decision has been taken by the courts.""Australia's role in caseMeanwhile the Australian Federal Police has been criticized for its part in the case.Speaking to media in Sydney last week AFP Deputy Commissioner Graham Ashton admitted the role his force played in the 2005 Bali arrests of the nine but denied it was responsible for what then transpired.Instead of stopping one of the convicted drug mules Scott Rush from traveling to Bali -- which had been the request of his parents -- the AFP alerted its counterpart the Indonesian National Police of his intentions. It offered the names of the conspirators some of whom had been on the AFP's radar.""The AFP had no evidence or lawful reason to detain much less arrest or charge any member of the Bali Nine before their departure from Australia "" the AFP noted in a February 7 statement.It also explained it could not limit ""its cooperation to countries that have similar legal systems as Australia."" The AFP is not compelled to answer requests for information about Australians from countries where the death penalty might be imposed but there are no guidelines to stop it volunteering information as it did with the Bali Nine.Opinion: Why executions won't win Indonesia's drug warRehabilitation claimedSukumaran and Chan have become model prisoners during their time behind bars according to fellow inmates and the jail's chief warden. Sukumaran is studying fine arts and has set up a class for fellow inmates. Chan has found spirituality which he uses to counsel inmates with drug problems.Their rehabilitation is genuine Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said.""Andrew and Myuran are the model of what penal systems the world over long to achieve "" Bishop told the Australian Parliament last week.The foreign affairs spokesperson for the opposition Australian Labor Party Tanya Plibersek delivered a personal account of what it means to be given a second chance.Long before she met her husband he'd been convicted in Australia of conspiracy to import heroin from Thailand where the death penalty applies to such crimes. Aged 19 Michael Coutts Trotter was sentenced to nine years in prison but released after three. He is now one of the most respected public servants in state of New South Wales and the father of three children all of which might not have been said Plibersek.""I feel a genuine debt of gratitude "" Michael Coutts Trotter told CNN.""So like it or not you have to accept a deeper sense of responsibility to try to make something useful of your life to repay the trust people have invested in you "" said Coutts Trotter the current Secretary of the Department of Family and Community Services.What may happen nextShort of a miracle redemption is not a gift likely to be offered to Sukumaran and Chan.If last-minute appeals fail Sukumaran and Chan will be allowed a few final choices: whether to stand or kneel wear a blindfold or face the 12 man firing squad one or more of whom will kill them.The hashtag #BoycottBali trends in Australia whenever news of the men's plight features in the media.While Chan's parents have now left Bali Sukumaran's will stay to the end. As they prepare for what appears inevitable it is surely little comfort for them to know that according to the Sydney Morning Herald the man police suspect was the mastermind of their son's trafficking enterprise is reportedly living a life of luxury in Sydney.He was investigated but escaped prosecution and is believed to have won U.S. $3.89 million in a lottery just after the young Australians were convicted.His fortunes stand in stark contrast to that of Sukumaran and Chan."
